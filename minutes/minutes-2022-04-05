## Discussion

### issues on agenda


#### issue #107 "Optical protection switching requires additional parameters "
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/107

Esther presented the scenario of Optical protection and a possible model enhancement to manage the protection.
See https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/files/8398878/Issue.for.optical.protection.switching.representation.pptx

The first question raised during the discussion was if splitter has to be considered and where is.
Two cases: Splitter is physically part of WDM-node or the Splitter is  on TXP 
Julien: only one direction is shown for convenience in the slide but the other direction is a mirror of the one shown. 

Gabriele: if the selector is an optical switch the criteria is the power,input-power. The threshold between the power of the 2 OTSi input of selector. 
Gabriele: The selector should belong to OLS.  
Julien: you could have both cases: selector can belong to TXP or to OLS
Gabriele: anyway the first issue raised in the slide it is not an issue
since even if TXP is outside the NW the end points are on splitter and selector
Dieter: splitter + roadm same te-node
Gabriele/Gert: 2 possibilities protection group or transceiver shadow
Gert: the wavelenght should be the same at tx and rx
Italo: OTSi 1,2 3, msust be on the same frequency. 

No conclusion the issue needs more anlysis. 
Post meeting note: Gert provided an update to the slides adding the "transceiver shadow case" https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/files/8420961/Issue.for.optical.protection.switching.representation.2.pptx

#### issue#24 : Model alignment with 400G-ZR
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/24

* There was a common agreement that the model is already suitable for any pluggable , no needs to have a specific model to cover 400G ZR+
* ZR+ is specified in OpenROADM , and as such it can be managed as an “MSA” fora organizational mode, see section 2.5.2 that already mention for a as part of organizational mode case.
* We need to be sure that this MSA organizational mode can be a superset of the list of explicit attributes. Need to be check the list of needed parameters for ZR+ (Gabriele)
* There could be an OTN compatibility issue for ZR+ that has to be verified. This could be an issue in case of 3R. Not only for ZR+ we could consider the opportunity to add an attribute to provide information regarding digital compatibility.

In general:
* The model with operational modes seems providing already way to manage compatibility issues
* We should probably digging more in scenario with 3R, but also in this case seems that operational mode could be enough.
* Client information are input of path computation, and are not part of the topology model. We can suppose that other model already provided this information.
* In case of zr+ we can add sentence to specify to be careful about operational modes e.g. you could have zr+-ethernet and zr+-otn
* The way happens ODUflex ODUCn mapping is an input to path computation. Maybe operational mode could be not sufficient. 
AP @Italo to check with ITU guys.

Gabriele was out of the meeting and we decided to wait for him to analyse more carefully his comment on https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/24#issuecomment-1054238457 before closing eventually the issue



## next meeting: April 12th 2022
