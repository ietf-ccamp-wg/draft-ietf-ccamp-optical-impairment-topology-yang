### Review APs (action point) Optical Impairment Topology YANG model

####issue #124 "*Remove key from media channel list*"
related to flexi-n value there is agreement to go ahead to delete the key statements from the media-channel-group/media-channel lists, 
making the flexi-n attribute optional.
A possible issue without key is to have more elements with the same flexi-n and we cannot have 2 media-channel with the same flexi-n.

**AP: Italo/Aihua** to have a look to possible YANG statement (e.g.unique statement) to overcome the issue

####issue #110 "*Unnecessary supported-modes level*"
The issue is the usage of "container" as immediate parent of a "list" 
After the update of the model for profiling the issue has been partially resolved 

**AP: Julien** to valuate if the updated model is enough to overcome the issue

### Review APs (action point) RFC9093-bis


### Closed Issues



### Next calls
next call on Tuesday, May 9th.

It was proposed to organize the following weekly call with an agenda addressing specific remaining issues to close. 
So the required "mandatory" participants to the meeting are the ones to which the different issues in agenda are assigned. 
Other possible attendees are "optional".


### YANG doctor review feedback
As required during IETF-116 presentation, a YANGdoctors review has been provided to both RFC9093-bis and OI Topology model .
Two specific issues have been added to address the answers to YANGdoctors
issues #68 https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/68 for RFC9093-bis and issue #133
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/133

We went through briefly the proposed replies for both YANGdoctors reviews.
People are welcome to review the proposed replies and add comments if needed. 

For OI Topology model we will update the model following the YANG doctor review suggestion as indicated in the github of issue#133
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/133


### General discussion

#### issue #133 Yangdoctors last call review of 
draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang-12 https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/133
No comments/concerns during the meeting about the possible update of the model along the lines indicated by YANG doctors and reported in issue#133.
A specific PR is foreseen to update the YANG model.

#### issue #62  of RFC9093-bis "Multiple line codings for the same ITU-T application code" 
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/62
We need to decide if to adopt with organizational and explicit mode the same approach we would use for application code as soon as the liaison 
from ITU-T will arrive.
see comment https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/62#issuecomment-1536481817

#### Issue #16 Need to align FEC Identities
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/16issue #16 

The agreement would be to stay with the three FEC as proposed in the comment
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/16#issuecomment-1508482369 .
Since the FEC types are defined in "available-fec-type" attribute that is of type identityref, nothing preclude in future new identities 
representing FEC types as soon as new standard FEC types should be proposed.
Before to close the issue we need to check YANG code if the related 3 identities for the 3 FEC types have been already defined
