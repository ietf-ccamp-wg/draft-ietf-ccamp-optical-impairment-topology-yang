### Review APs (action point) 
related to flexi-n value there is agreement to go ahead to delete the key statements from the media-channel-group/media-channel lists, making the flexi-n attribute optional.
A possible issue without key is to have more elements with the same flexi-n and we cannot have 2 media-channel with the same flexi-n.

**AP: Italo/Aihua** to have a look to possible YANG statement (e.g.unique statement) to overcome the issue

### Closed Issues

#### issue #26 Convention for ITU-T Recommendations https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/26

the last decision is that "If it is not prohibit the usage of "." , we can use the "." also in YANG statements.
RFC8407 allows using the "." for ITU-T Recommendation numbers since it is a well-know value (see https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/26#issuecomment-1503279997)

### Next calls
next call on Tuesday, May 2nd.
The weekly call foreseen for April 25th, will be deleted due to a bank holiday in Italy.


### General discussion


### YANG doctor review feedback
As required during IETF-116 presentation, a YANGdoctors review has been provided to both RFC9093-bis and OI Topology model .
Two specific issues have been added to address the answers to YANGdoctors
issues #68 https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/68 for RFC9093-bis and 
issue #133 https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/133

We went through briefly the proposed replies for both YANGdoctors reviews.
People are welcome to review the proposed replies and add comments if needed. 

### RFC9093-bis issues review and priority

Following what discussed during the presentation made in IETF 116, we started to review some of the issues still open in RFC9093-bis.
The intention is to valuate which of these issues can  create dependency on Optical Impairments Topology YANG model.

#### issue #65 pyang tree length issue   https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/65

Related to this issue it was decided to add a new issue for both RFC9093-bis and OI aware Topology YANG model, to check length of the names of attributes and 
see where it is possible to shorten them.
see 
* issue #134 https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/134  for OI Topology model
* issue #69 https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/69 for RFC9093-bis

#### Issue #64 Downrefs https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/64

The issue could be solved just putting "Informative reference" instead of "normative reference"

#### Issue #56 Name for the channel spacing type https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/56

see proposal https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/56#issuecomment-1498817041

why do not use nominal central frequency granularity e.g. dwdm-ncf-granularity-type from now on in RFC9093-bis instead of channel spacing ?

#### Issue #61 Question from Julien during Last Call (Jan, 2022) https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/61 

We need to add text in RFC9093-bis draft to clarify that the available nominal central frequencies are correlated with m=1
as stated in Section 3.1 of RFC8363.
To be fixed in the next update.

The fact to add or not the text also in flexi-grid I-D will be discussed in the flexi-grid Thursday's calls.

#### Issue #33 Label encoding w/ branching https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/33

No strong position, need to have Julien to decide.
No impact for OI draft since "flexi-grid-label-hop" grouping, where the branching is defined, is not used in the topology model for OI. 

Potential problem for BC. 
An alternative option could be to define a new grouping and either do not modify the flexi-grid-label-hop grouping or deprecate it.

An alternative option could be not to change the YANG model but to clarify that the (super) case can be used also for single channel e.g. in the layer0-types-ext.

Last proposal from Julien: do not change the YANG but specify in the text there should be a unique way to describe a single-channel label
(i.e., prevent the use of super in case of single n) : this would avoid possible IW problem

#### Issue #16 Need to align FEC Identities
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/16

see last proposal https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/16#issuecomment-1508482369 

Gert:we need to check if there could be interworking problems.
The RS FEC is terminated between the host and the module.
There are different interleaving defined for RS modualtion formats and the question is if an impact for interoperability can exist.
The conclusions are:
- We need to have Gabriele since, together with Enrico, has provided the list of new RS different FEC types
- Apparently the proposal to focus only on FEC definition that are actually used for line transmission can be acceptable,
provided that further investigation would be needed to clarify if interworking problem can be possible with RS modulation formats.

#### Issue #10 Need for frequency and power range attributes also with Standard Mode 
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/10

G.698.2 application codes also defines the minimum and maximum central frequency to be supported (see clause 7.2.2 of G.698.2)
G.698.2 application codes also defines the minimum and maximum channel output power to be supported (see clause 7.2.1 of G.698.2)
G.698.2 application codes also defines the minimum and maximum mean input power to be supported (see clause 7.4.1 of G.698.2)

Therefore it seems useful to add also to the standard mode the attributes used to report the frequency and power ranges supported by a given transceiver 
for a given application code.

No comment/concern during the meeting about the possible update of the model.
