### Review APs (action point) 


### Closed Issues
The issue realted to the power penalty #118, has been moved to RFC9093-bis issue #66, since the needed YANG modifications have to be done 
in that module. The issue will be closed linked to the next PR for RFC9093-bis.

### Next calls
Next call will be regularly next week January, 24th 
 
### Discussion

#### Issue #108 Add an Appendix to the draft describing how the YANG model supports remote optical transponders connected to a WDM-node

Italo/Sergio analysed the model against the requirement on remote transponders shelf connected to add/drop ports of a WDM-TE node.
As feedback of this analysis Sergio showed a couple of slides summarizing the basic doubts still open (see slide).

The basic issue discussed is the one reported in the first bullet related to flexi-n value.

Esther: I do not understand why it is mentioned that there is "no filters". The filters exist on the right in ROADM.
Enrico: Yes, WSS is typically with filtering 
Esther: the information regarding N,M are present on ROADM. So a controller can get the info and coordinate between 
the external shelf and the ROADM.
Italo: But this is not possible if external shelf is under another controller 
Gabriele: You need to know always the characteristics of transceiver but you do not need information for provisioning of the transceiver
until you do not know what type of service you want to have e.g the needed spectrum is related to media channel in the ROADM not for transceiver.
So no need flexi-n information in the left part (TSPs) in the picture. 
At the end it seems that flexi-n information is not useful and not needed at TSP level and so it is needed to find a solution in the context of the model, since flexi-n is the key attribute in the list of media channel.
We have three options:
1) The easiest is to simply delete the key statements from the media-channel-group/media-channel lists, making the flexi-n attribute optional,
exploiting the fact that in a list that is not a data node for configuration and that is not referenced along the YANG module so it seems that 
the "key" is not needed.

```
       +--ro media-channel-group* []
       |  +--ro media-channels* []
       |     +--ro flexi-n?          l0-types:flexi-n
       |     +--ro flexi-m?          l0-types:flexi-m

```

2) Italo suggestion: modify the type of flexi-n as union between the present flexi-n typedef as type int16 and a wildcard value when unknown.
3) Esther suggestion and preferred solution: convention value determined by a decided rule that should be described in the draft.
(for example: use the closest and smallest flexi-n to the lowest carrier center frequency in the OTSiG, 
if center frequencies are (193.13, 193.178) , n = 5, if center frequency is 193.109375, n=1)

AP: @All to check feasibility for option 1 looking at the possible impact on the rest of the model as Esther mentioned.
    

### issues on agenda

####  


#### Issue#62 Multiple line codings for the same ITU-T application code  
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/62

Gert asked if there were any conclusion regarding the issue to have the same ITU-T application-code with more than one line-coding associated,
creating potential IW issue when the two ends are configured with the application code -- 
e.g. one using OTL4.4-SC and the other using FOIC1.4-SC that are defined as possible alternatives for the same application 
code in Rec. ITU-T G.698.2 (11/2018).

Sergio said that Dieter checked internally with ITU-T Q6 expert to have some off-line feedback. 
The feedback was reported in github https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/62#issuecomment-1292030115, basically saying that G.698.2 defines optical specs for a class of optical tributary signals that can have different bit rates and line codings. The Reccomendation does not cover IW that instead has to be considered by the user.

No official e-mail has been sent yet to the ITU-T to have an offical answer to the issue.
Gert/Gabriele think that it would be better to send the e-mail to the ITU-T (the text is already in
github : https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/62#issuecomment-1291955050).

None is opposing to this suggestion, but a check with CCAMP chairs need to be done to understand the liaison process.

AP @Sergio: to check with Daniele Ceccarelli how to proceed for official communication to ITU-T.

##### post-meeting notes 

I've checked with Daniele and sent an email on December 12 proposing our agreed text for liaison.
What Daniele explained to me is that as soon we have an agreed text there is a ITU-T delegate in CCAMP for the relationship with
ITU-T who should take care of the needed action.
Since no concerns have been received by WG, I sent an email January 18th, asking for next steps.
