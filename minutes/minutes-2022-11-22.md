#### RX power penalty #118 https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/118

Eliana presented the new issue introducing it exploiting a picture representing a curve of Power-Rx and related OSNR in B2B.

The request is basically to extend the operative region of the receiver to permit the usage of more node configuration with potential advantages in therms of optimization and costs.
Basically a new list of penalties associated with received powers values, lower that the minimum channel power value, has been proposed to be added in the model.
No concerns were raised about this request and how to code in YANG.
Dieter suggested that in the definition should be added the formula describing OSNR (Rx power).
A possible description would be:

"description
  "Optional OSNR penalty associated with received power values below rx-channel-power-min.
This list describes the OSNR penalty as a function of the rx-channel-power in the form of (rx-channel-power, penalty-value) pairs.
OSNR (rx-channel-power) = min-OSNR + penalty-value";"

Gert suggested that would be more exhaustive in this use case to consider not only the part of the curve related to positive values of
penalties but also the other part in which penalty values are negative.
Eliana commented that it could make sense to enlarge the possible penalty to negative values. 
The actual model is using a grouping in which the range of admitted values is only positive (range "0..max in YANG syntax).
Italo suggested before any changes to check possible impact in the other cases of penalty , since the same grouping is used in other 
list of penalty (chromatic-dispersion-penalty, polarization-dispersion-penalty, max-pol-dependent-loss-penalty), and using also negative values of penalty could not be fine for other cases.
Dieter agreed on that and suggested to check the definitions in YANG of the other list of penalty. 
Italo suggested that having a similar curve as above for the other functions might help understanding whether or not the penalty values could also be negative. 
A pdf version of these curves would be sufficient for this discussion.
There was agreement on that. 
The discussion is interrupted due to time over.

#### Feedback from IETF115
##### Discussion
Sergio presented a couple of slides summarizing the feedback from IETF115 CCAMP meeting regarding Optical Impairments and RFC9093-bis.
The basic question raised during the meeting was if the solution for OPS protection provided in OI draft can be generic in order to be used also by the other L0 topologies not only OI based,i.e. WSON and Flexgrid.

Dieter commented that if making generic the OI solution would mean to move structures in other drafts this was negative since it is creating "dependency". 
Italo/Aihua raised the point that if other modules (e.g., the WSON and flexi-grid topology models) would re-use, for applications which do not required OI information, some generic constructs (e.g., the 3R model) from the l0-types, that would create potential duplication of codes with problem when you need to support these other models (e.g., the WSON and flexi-grid topology models) together with the OI topology model.
The alternative is to have a "modular" approach that would imply to move part of the OI YANG structures in a different module/draft which can be used with or without the augmentations provided in the OI YANG model depending on whether the application requires or not OI information.
Gert:asked clarification about duplication 
Italo: For example, considering the wson topology and ops case, in a non-modular approach you need to copy the additional-ltp list within the new version of WSON topology model to report OPS capability in a WSON topology which does not require the OI information. When this version of the WSON topology is used, with multi-inheritance, together with the OI topology, the resulting topology instance will have two lists of additional-ltp one coming from WSON topology and one coming from OI topology.

```

    "network": [
      {
        "network-id": "WSON topology",
        "network-types": {

            "wsont:wson-topology"
          }
        },

          {
            "tet:tunnel-termination-point": [
              {
                "wsont:additional-ltp": []
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "network-id": "OI topology",
        "network-types": {
          "tet:te-topology": {
            "oit:optical-impairments-topology"
          }
        },
        "node": [
          {
            "tet:tunnel-termination-point": [
              {
                "oit:additional-ltp": []
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "network-id": "WSON and OI topology",
        "network-types": {
          "tet:te-topology": {
            "wsont:wson-topology": {},
            "oit:optical-impairments-topology": {}
          }
        },
        "node": [
          {
            "tet:tunnel-termination-point": [
              {
                "wsont:additional-ltp": [],
                "oit:additional-ltp": []
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }    
    ]
  }
}
```

With a modular approach, it is possible to use multiple inheritance using the current WSON topology model and a the new module together, with or without the OI YANG model depending on whetther OI information is needed or not.

          }

              }
            ]
          }
        ]

      {

            "wdmt:wdm-topology" {
              "oit:optical-impairments-topology"
            }
          }
        },
        "node": [
          {
            "tet:tunnel-termination-point": [
              {
                "wdmt:additional-ltp": []
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "network-id": "WSON and OI topology",
        "network-types": {
          "tet:te-topology": {
            "wsont:wson-topology" {},
            "wdmt:wdm-topology" {
              "oit:optical-impairments-topology"
            }
          }
        },
        "node": [
          {
            "tet:tunnel-termination-point": [
              {
                "wdmt:additional-ltp": []
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }    
    ]
  }
}
```

Julien: flexgrid is a superset you do not have to use WSON as trigger.
Italo: Another alternative is to define new "network-type" practically "per use cases" rather than exploit multi-inheritance approach when some functionality that is defined in a particular network-type but instead is defined in another network-type.
Sergio argued that in reality a usual solution exist, and is to import OI module and if specific OI information are not needed , exploiting the "optional" statement usage in most of OI attributes, the user cna create an instance with only the part of OI module he needs to have.
This is the usual "profiling" process usable in teas-topology and then in modules augmenting that basic topology model.
Esther commented at the end of the meeting that she does not understand really what is the issue: from Orange prospective they ahve implemented OI module, flexible grid and tunnel model and they do not have any problem of duplication of code.
