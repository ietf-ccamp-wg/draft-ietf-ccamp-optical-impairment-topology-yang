### Review APs (action point) Optical Impairment Topology YANG model

#### issue #124 "*Remove key from media channel list*"
related to flexi-n value there is agreement to go ahead to delete the key statements from the media-channel-group/media-channel lists, 
making the flexi-n attribute optional.
A possible issue without key is to have more elements with the same flexi-n and we cannot have 2 media-channel with the same flexi-n.

**AP: Italo/Aihua** to have a look to possible YANG statement (e.g.unique statement) to overcome the issue

Need to make some json examples and make the validation with yanglint.
You cannot have two media channel in the same media channel group with the same flexi-n. See figure 5 in section 2.3.4

       +--ro media-channel-groups!
       |  +--ro media-channel-group* [i]
       |     +--ro i                 int16
       |     +--ro media-channels* []
       |        +--ro flexi-n?          l0-types:flexi-n
       |        +--ro flexi-m?          l0-types:flexi-m

Need to check if "unique" statement is still valid when flexi-n is not present.
Esther: flexi-n if it exists must be unique in the media-channel-group upper level list.

#### #130 "Documenting mandatory profile for OI applications"

**AP: Esther** will provide a description of the various attributes that even if optional in the model, are needed for OI application. 
These attributes will be described in specifc context.

Let's try to have this list in a couple of weeks from now.


### Review APs (action point) RFC9093-bis

#### Issue #21 "Review otu-type identities"  
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/21

**AP: @Aihua: to verify with Haomian if these otu identities are needed and where they are defined (some, but not all, are defined in G.Sup43)**

### Closed Issues Optical Impairment Topology

Closed issues from last IETF117 has been reported in the presentation during IETF118 

issue #134 "Try to shorten the names of attributes"
issue #155 "Absolute path in grouping power-param", 
issue #158 "delta-power contains a ratio in dB. one may call it gain, however gain is only positive, where delta_p could be negative. 
so the type should be changed",
issue #159 "remove from the model grouping sliceable-transponder-attributes"

There is a proposal to solve these issue in PR#160 https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/pull/160

PR#160 approved and ready to be merged pending merging of RFC9093-bis PR#82

### Closed Issues RFC9093-bis

### Optical Impairment Topology YANG model

#### #153  "Adding guideline for DGE representation"  
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/153

#### #145 "Update Security Considerations"

Sergio uploaded to github a first draft for security section.





### Discussion

#### DGE guideline issue#153- Optical Impairment 

We agreed:

In specific case as DGE, to take into account OI, amplifier are considered as sequence of element to take into account gain/attenuation of the different elements.

* multi-band amplification in parallel.
* 3 elements in sequence per band.
* new attribute as stage-order to characerize the stage of amplifier-element in the sequence
* "is-dynamic-gain-equalyzer" attribute is correctly at the level of amplifier-element to make explicit what of the elements is sequence is DGE, to avoid ambiguity.

Issue still to be clarified: 

* Need to understand if type-variety need to be replicated per element.

Roberto has proposed new text and YANG proposal ,
see https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/153#issuecomment-1880596742

"In order to support the modelling of multi bandwidth (parallel)
and multi stage (cascaded) amplifier like in picture xxx, 
the OMS element that describe an optical amplifier contains an unordered 
list of amplifier-element. The position of the elements is bases 
on the following two attributes:

- the lower-frequecy and upper-frequecy attributre indentify the set of amplifier-element that support a specific spectrum bandwidth
- the stage-order attribute allow to define for each spectrum badwidththe cascade order of amplifier-element.

The detailed rapresentation of the amplifier stage is not mandatory in general,
but in the case the OMS-element has both the function of Amplifier and DGE (refer 
section 2.5) the implementation MUST provide the cascade order details of
amplifier-element in order to allow a proper modelling of the impairment"

Here the YANG porposal:

                |  +--ro amplifier
                |     +--ro type-variety    string
                |     +--ro operational
                |        +--ro amplifier-element* []
                |           +--ro name?
                |           |       string
                |           +--ro is-dynamic-gain-equalyzer?
                |           |       boolean
                |           +--ro frequency-range
                |           |  +--ro lower-frequency    frequency-thz
                |           |  +--ro upper-frequency    frequency-thz
                |           +--ro stage-order? int


Italo commented about the last part of the text, proposing a more generic text to generalize the sentence related to the possibility to abstract 
or not the amplifier characterisitcs. 
**AP @Italo** to propose some text to generalize the text below:

"The detailed rapresentation of the amplifier stage is not mandatory in general,
but in the case the OMS-Elemtn has both the funtion of Amplifier and DGE (refer 
section 2.5) the implementation MUST provide the cascade order details of
amplifier element in order to allow a proper modelling of the impairment"



For the rest the proposal from Roberto has been agreed.


#### Update security Consideration issue#145- Optical Impairment


About security is still open the discussion about the rw vs. ro data nodes.
To summarize the issue , in the text proposed for security it is stated that the data nodes in the YANG module are not writable , are readable only.
Gert observed that a couple of data nodes "protection-type" and "inter-layer-sequance-number" are rw. Gert suggested we should consider our OI topology model
as "information-source-entry" in RFC8795 representing readable topology information while RFC8795 is also able to modify data nodes adding links/nodes ,
obtaining a combination of the real topology and what if something is added in the model. 
As stated in the previous meeting we have kepf data nodes as rw for consistency with RFC8795.
The topology models have been defined as rw to support other UCs where the topology information can be written by the client applications and we have defined
the LTP protection-type as rw to be consistent with the link-protection-type attribute defined in RFC8795 that we are using to report OMS protection configuration
Both Esther and Italo commented that there are use cases that could justify to have e.g. protection-type rw.
If it is possible to modify protection-type for OMS protection it should also be possible to modify protection-type for OTSi protection using the
augmented data node in our OI topology model. This would be a use case justifying the possibility to use writable data nodes also in our topology model,
independently of RFC8795.

The discussion is on going. Maybe a short separate cal would be needed to complete and close the issue, permitting to finalize the security text.

### Post meeting notes

About "Need to understand if type-variety need to be replicated per element." **the proposal is to
replicate type-variety at amplifier-element but as optional attribute** since the oms-element level might not encompass all combination of amps especially in case
of switchable gain cases.
Type-variety at OMS-element level will remain mandatory and type-variety at amplifier-element is needed only in case the type-variety attribute at OMS-element level is not providing sufficient information on the type-variety for the amplifier-element.

About the question from Enrico https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/153#issuecomment-1881637849 
regarding the parameters like tilt, in-voa/out-voa that would not be part in case of DGE and so should be optional, 
the proposal is to use a choice on the mutually exclusive attributes to keep amp parameters such as gain, voa, … mandatory. In this way, 
if is-dynamic-gain-equalyzer is present, Gain, voa, … are not present and reversely.
In case the amp element is a dge, dynamic-gain-equalizer should be mandatory.
