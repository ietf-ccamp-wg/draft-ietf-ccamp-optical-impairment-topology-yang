### Review APs (action point) Optical Impairment Topology YANG model

#### issue #124 "*Remove key from media channel list*"
related to flexi-n value there is agreement to go ahead to delete the key statements from the media-channel-group/media-channel lists, making the flexi-n attribute optional.
A possible issue without key is to have more elements with the same flexi-n and we cannot have 2 media-channel with the same flexi-n.

**AP: Italo/Aihua** to have a look to possible YANG statement (e.g.unique statement) to overcome the issue

Need to make some json examples and make the validation with yanglint.
You cannot have two media channel in the same media channel group with the same flexi-n. See figure 5 in section 2.3.4

       +--ro media-channel-groups!
       |  +--ro media-channel-group* [i]
       |     +--ro i                 int16
       |     +--ro media-channels* []
       |        +--ro flexi-n?          l0-types:flexi-n
       |        +--ro flexi-m?          l0-types:flexi-m

Need to check if "unique" statement is still valid when flexi-n is not present.
Esther: flexi-n if it exists must be unique in the media-channel-group upper level list.

### Discussion

#### Optical Impairment Topology YANG model

New PR#173 https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/pull/173



#### RFC9093-bis

New PR#100 https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/pull/100

For both PR the decision was to discuss the pending issue reported in github related to the two PR in the next call 
when a sufficient level of attendance of the meeting is foreseen to be reached.

Gert made a comment realted to the new definiton of operational-mode that has been reproted back to "string".
Now Gert's perplexity was the risk to have operational-mode definition too long.
Gert proposed to think about the possibility to put a restriction lenght to operationa√≤l-mode definition.
We need to tke into account that as reproted in RFC7950, a built-in string has no limitation.
