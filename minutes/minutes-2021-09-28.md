### discussion

The group discussed to close some issues in the list.
The issues will be definetely closed linked to the forthcoming PRs.

* issue #89
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/89

This is the definite text all attendees agreed:
"OTSIs is required in the topology model as input to the path computation since before adding a new OTSi it is needed to understand 
the impact of the existing OTSis on the optical impairments of the new OTSi as well as the impact of the new OTSi on the optical impairments of the existing OTSis.
To compute performance it is needed to have information regarding the baudrate ,power and carrier-frequency of the different  OTSi in the OMS .
Besides, you also need to know which OTSi are added/ dropped in the ROADM,to compute overall channel power in ROADMs, in order to check ROADM’s power constraints.
In our model, OTSi is providing this ‘lightpath’ information, and is right now the only element that enables to identify which piece of spectrum is occupied 
by which type of channel (baudrate,power, …) thanks to the pointer (YANG leafref relation) with transceiver."

Dieter will create new branch for the document to put the new text and will propose it in a PR.

* issue #42
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/42

This issue was linked to a PR of layer0-type-ext model, but then there was decision of deleting 
"OTSi-carrier-bandwidth" and add "minimum-channel-spacing" on behalf.
So a new PR would be needed to close finally this issue.
Moreover a definition of "minimum-channel-spacing"was proposed first by Enrico/Dieter/Sergio 
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/42#issuecomment-821097420

Some modifications to the proposed text has been proposed https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/42#issuecomment-824717620

Now Italo summarized the status in the last comment,here the link of the last Italo's comment 
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/42#issuecomment-924163449

Enrico observed that interference, due to spectrum overlapping of two adjacent channels, is normally taken into account in the X-talk 
parameter encompassing different impairment contribution between two different channels,even if not adjacent.  

It was definitely agreed this text for the minimum-carrier-spacing definition:

"This attribute specifies the minimum nominal difference between the carrier frequencies of two homogeneous OTSis (which have the same optical characteristics 
but the central frequencies) such that if they are placed next to each other the interference due to spectrum overlap between them can be considered negligible.
In case of heterogeneous OTSi it is up to path computation engine to determine the minimum distance between the carrier frequency of the two adjacent OTSi."

* issue #56 
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/56

Among the attributes present in the optical-fiber-data grouping Esther suggested to get "chromatic dispersion" CD and add to fiber-params.
No neeed to add detailed vaules for type-variety. You can get these attributes from inventory.

For the rest of the parameters:
-no need to have input and output power in fiber, while these values should be available in the amplifiers, as measured power (there is already another issue for that #85)
-pmd is already present in fiber-params
-OSNR and sigma are not an attribute of a fiber, but instead they are results of computation coming from the parameters present in amplifiers and fibers.

*  issue #57

About the grouping optical-channel-data, the group agrees to remove it from the file.
