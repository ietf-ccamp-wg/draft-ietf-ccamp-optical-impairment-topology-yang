### General discussion


### RFC9093-bis issues review and priority

Following what discussed during the presentation made in IETF 116, we started to review some of the issues still open in RFC9093-bis.
The intention is to valuate which of these issues can  create dependency on Optical Impairments Topology YANG model.

#### issue #65 pyang tree length issue   https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/65

Related to this issue it was decided to add a new issue for both RFC9093-bis and OI aware Topology YANG model, to check length of the names of attributes and see where 
it is possible to shorten them.

#### Issue #64 Downrefs https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/64

The issue could be solved just putting "Informative reference" instead of "normative reference"

#### Issue #56 Name for the channel spacing type https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/56

see proposal https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/56#issuecomment-1498817041

#### Issue #61 Question from Julien during Last Call (Jan, 2022) https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/61 

We need to add text in RFC9093-bis draft to clarify that the available nominal central frequencies are correlated with m=1
as stated in Section 3.1 of RFC8363.

The fact to add or not the text also in flexi-grid I-D will be discussed in the flexi-grid Thursday's calls.

#### Issue #33 Label encoding w/ branching https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/33

No strong position, need to have Julien to decide.
No impact for OI draft since "flexi-grid-label-hop" grouping, where the branching is defined, is not used in the topology model for OI. 

Potential problem for BC. 
An alternative option could be to define a new grouping and either do not modify the flexi-grid-label-hop grouping or deprecate it.

#### issue #26 Convention for ITU-T Recommendations https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/26

the last decision is that "If it is not prohibit the usage of "." , we can use the "." also in YANG statements.
RFC8407 allows using the "." for ITU-T Recommendation numbers since it is a well-know value (see https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/26#issuecomment-1503279997)
