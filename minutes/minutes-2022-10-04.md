### Review APs (action point) 



#### issue#24 : Model alignment with 400G-ZR
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/24
moved to https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext/issues/51
in layer0-types-ext (draft-ietf-ccamp-rfc9093-bis-01)

-YANG modification : add Inband (IB) OSNR , Out-of-band (OOB) OSNR , Transmitter polarization dependent power difference X-Y skew
**AP @italobusi @sergiobelotti** : to add the parameters in YANG layer0-types-ext , grouping common-explicit

-Tx output power with transmit disabled: need to clarify the meaning since no definition exists both in the OIF IA and in Open ZR+ MSA documents. 
**AP : @ggalimba56 : to check internally**

-Looking at ITU-T G.698.2 there are cases in which at one application code corresponds 2 line-coding. This would be a problem for IW 
e.g. in case operational mode is used for transponder (same application code but possible different line coding, no interworking).
We decided to leave ITU-T to deal with that and put some text raising the point. 
**AP @dieterbeller **to modify the draft adding the text.

For the parameter for which there is no standard reference , as soon as text definiton is ready it will be provided in github (see AP @ggalimba56 : to check internally)

#### issue #107 "Optical protection switching requires additional parameters "
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/107

Background:

-With the last update for IETF-114 we have modeled how to represent the existing OTSi already there in the network in case of protection
--> we consider impairments impact of the different paths associated with existing OTSi on the optical feasibility for a new OTSi

-Capability reporting still to be introduced in the model

-There was one general comment on the model from Gabriele, who said the the proposal could be good but an "entity" 
providing the E2E view of the OTSi is missing in the model.
Italo said that this "entity" is the tunnel (or LSP as instantiation of tunnel) 
but he has doubt on the need to add this information to a topology model when this concept should be part of an extension 
of the te-tunnel model, for which we already have L0 extension (WSON and flexible grid) but not optical impairments.
Sergio/Dieter raised the comment about the introduction of dependency on tunnel model in the case we would decide 
to exploit that as referecne for the E2E OTSi entity.

We all agree that an extension to tunnel model taking into account OI is needed, but discussion has to be taken separate form the context of this draft,
that is for topology only.

2 problems:
How to split traffic using LLCL that has a TP as key in the list
AD1 and AD2  implications: We do not want to break the abstraction in the node but we need to model the possibility that from the transceiver ,
after the splitter, the path toward LTP belonging to the protection, can be different depending on the add-drop ports chosen
One promising solution for 1. is to add in the LLC list that has TP as key, an additional list of TP for which the traffic can be splitted. 
This list will be present only in case of protection.
Maybe a YANG feature “OPS” can be used to make explicit the supporting of the capability
Alignment with the solution in case OT is outside of WDM-TE-node and we use connectivity matrix, 
that already permits to have multiple entries related to the same line port (LTP).

+--ro drop-path-impairments?   leafref

##### Discussion
As planned a couple of scenarios and related json file have been presented to explain the solution for capability reporting in case of WDM-TE-node integrated.
Related slides and the json file have been uploaded in
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/files/9696686/optical.protection.switching-21.pptx and
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/files/9696713/ops-protection-examples-1.txt.
We have discussed the cases of 2 TE nodes (no more single node as the previous one)for which we should use connectivity-matrix model entity. 
Also for the connectivity matrix we understoood that a similar additional list as in LLCL structure is probabbly needed to provide the LTPs OUT associated
to the source LTP IN and related OI in case the usage of different AD.![](https://codimd.s3.shivering-isles.com/demo/uploads/7b0baa97-e0db-40f3-980b-77faadd8d3e0.png)
We would add an additional list in the "from" TP part of the connectivity-matrix to provide the "merging" part and an additional LTP list in the
"to" TP part of the connectivity matrix for the "splitting" part.

In case of scenario with splitter outside of WDM-TE-node (slide 33 of the package), nothing change with respect WDM-TE-node 2 , 
for which the two paths coming from WDM-TE-node 1 are 2 unprotected paths.
For WDM-TE-node 1 the model approach should be the same as in case 1 for single node , with restrict connectivity for the two LTP outgoing ports since no matrix
is present and there is fixed connectivity between the splitter and output ports (LTP5 and LTP 6 ) in the picture. Only disjointness between the two paths 
coming out from the two outgoing LTP should be mandatory for path computation.

Need to setup a specific YANG model meeting to agree the YANG updates.
Post meeting notes:
the meeting has been done and a yang tree proposal summarizing the results of the meeting is included in the uploaded package 

#### Issue with new IETF tool

As happen to Gabriele a couple of weeks ago, Dieter reported problems with the xml2rfc IETF tool. He said the compilation failed and strange errors appears e.g. ![](https://codimd.s3.shivering-isles.com/demo/uploads/7036b3f7-3901-464d-8c3d-0ad11037c1ed.png). 
He will try to get in touch with IETF tools guys to ask guidelines.
