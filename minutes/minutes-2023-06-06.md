### Review APs (action point) Optical Impairment Topology YANG model

####issue #124 "*Remove key from media channel list*"
related to flexi-n value there is agreement to go ahead to delete the key statements from the media-channel-group/media-channel lists, 
making the flexi-n attribute optional.
A possible issue without key is to have more elements with the same flexi-n and we cannot have 2 media-channel with the same flexi-n.

**AP: Italo/Aihua** to have a look to possible YANG statement (e.g.unique statement) to overcome the issue

Need to make some json examples and make the validation with yanglint.
You cannot have two media channel in the same media channel group with the same flexi-n. See figure 5 in section 2.3.4

       +--ro media-channel-groups!
       |  +--ro media-channel-group* [i]
       |     +--ro i                 int16
       |     +--ro media-channels* []
       |        +--ro flexi-n?          l0-types:flexi-n
       |        +--ro flexi-m?          l0-types:flexi-m

Need to check if "unique" statement is still valid when flexi-n is not present.
Esther: flexi-n if it exists must be unique in the media-channel-group upper level list.


### Review APs (action point) RFC9093-bis

####issue #16 "*Need to align FEC Identities*" 
We agree to add new 3 FEC type :+1: 
* SC-FEC
* oFEC
* C-FEC
We agree to delete:
* reed-solomon : since we agreed to focus only on FEC definition that are actually used for line transmission, 
we agreed to delete "reed-solomon" YANG identity (used for client connection)
* haming-code, golay : delete the YANG identities

* g-fec and e-fec : add correct descriptions and referecne standard (if exist)
**AP: @Gabriele to help providing possible description and standard referecne**

#### closed AP
Gabriele is suggesting to stay as we are about description ,
just changing enhanced-FEC with super-FEC, since enhanced does not exist.
Moreover we need to add the referecne to ITU-T G.975 for g-FEC and G.975.1 for super-FEC.
see final comment in github https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/16#issuecomment-1578763060

####Issue #10 Need for frequency and power range attributes also with Standard Mode

it seems that G.698.2 does not mandate transceivers to be tunable nor to support tunability for the whole frequency range between 
the minimum and maximum frequency.
Then *it could be useful to add also to the standard mode the attributes used to report the frequency and power ranges supported by a 
given transceiver for a given application code*

**AP: @Italo, @Sergio to to check off-line with Q6 experts if our understanding is correct**


### Closed Issues (from last IETF)

Issue #3 ietf-layer0-types-ext 
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/3

Issue #26 Convention for ITU-T Recommendations
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/26

Issue #110 Unnecessary supported-modes level
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/110

### Next calls
June 13th 

### YANG doctor review feedback

We have updated both RFC9093-bis and OI topology model 
following the YANG doctor review suggestion as indicated in the github of issue#133
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/133
and https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/68.

Please review the two PRs #70 and #135: 
* for RFC9093-bis https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/pull/70
* for OI topology model https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/pull/135

Need to change the pmd unit in ps for drop and express path.
Esther: instead of polarization Mode dispersion we may need to use DGD (differential group delay). 
**AP:@Esther to check with PSE TIP group when discussion in are finished**.

### General discussion
 
#### issue#9 Guidance for unique organization identifier
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/9

Need to provide guidance on how to make the organization-identifier unique (e.g., using an OUI or another IANA assigned registry, 
for further discussion/investigation).

##### Discussion

The possibilites are to use OUI or to use identityref to identities to be defined
in an organization specific YANG model.

Julien: Trying to have a solution supporting both options. 

#### issue #7 DC-DP-QAM8 and DC-DP-QAM16
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/7

##### Discussion

The final decision was to remove from the model all the modulation formats with DC- as prefix .

#### issue #16 Need to align FEC identities
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/16

##### Discussion


To close the issue, in addition to the introduction of the new FEC:

SC-FEC
identity sc-fec {
base fec-type;
description
"Staircase FEC";
reference
"ITU-T Annex A/G.709.2 v1.1 (09/2020):OTU4 long-reach interface";
}

oFEC
identity o-fec {
base fec-type;
description
"Open FEC as defined by OpenROADM forum";
reference
"ITU-T clause 16.4.4/G.709.3 and reuses the
BCH FEC defined in ITU-T Annex E/G.709.3";
}

C-FEC
identity c-fec {
base fec-type;
description
"Concatenated FEC (C-FEC) that combines an outer SC-FEC
outer code and an inner double-extended
SD-FEC (128,119) Hamming code";
reference
"outer SC-FEC, defined in Annex A/G.709.2, with an inner Hamming SD-FEC, defined in Annex D/G.709.3. 
More details are provided in clause 15/G.709.3 where it is called DSH instead of concatenated FEC
}

we need to change enhanced-FEC with Super-FEC, and add the reference to ITU- Rec. :

identity g-fec {
base fec-type;
description
"G-FEC (Generic-FEC)";
reference
"ITU-T G.975";
}
identity super-fec {
base fec-type;
description
"S-FEC (Super-FEC)";
reference
"ITU-T G.975.1";
}
