## Power Equalization rules for OMS issue#37
Esther: Esther raised the problem regarding the actual definiton of nominal-channel-power and power-spectral-density for which it is needed to have
a clear "reference point" for the measure. 
see slide 1 in the presentation [](https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/37#issuecomment-804887246)

the nominal-channel-power is actually the nominal-carrier-power but would lead to non-optimal power distribution with flexible grid 

the nominal-power-spectral-density is the ratio between the carrier-power and the carrier-bandwidth

agreed to remove the nominal-channel-power option since no longer valid with modern DWDM network but keep the choice to allow additional rules to be defined

need to state in the text that the nominal-power-spectra-density applies to a reference point at the input of the OMS (that is in our model, starting from booster amplifier)

need to add a delta-power in dB (with respect to the nominal-carrier-power) or delta power spectral density in dB. The delta-power is defined once for OMS.
