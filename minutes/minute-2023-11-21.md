### Review APs (action point) Optical Impairment Topology YANG model

####issue #124 "*Remove key from media channel list*"
related to flexi-n value there is agreement to go ahead to delete the key statements from the media-channel-group/media-channel lists,
making the flexi-n attribute optional.
A possible issue without key is to have more elements with the same flexi-n and we cannot have 2 media-channel with the same flexi-n.

**AP: Italo/Aihua** to have a look to possible YANG statement (e.g.unique statement) to overcome the issue

Need to make some json examples and make the validation with yanglint.
You cannot have two media channel in the same media channel group with the same flexi-n. See figure 5 in section 2.3.4

       +--ro media-channel-groups!
       |  +--ro media-channel-group* [i]
       |     +--ro i                 int16
       |     +--ro media-channels* []
       |        +--ro flexi-n?          l0-types:flexi-n
       |        +--ro flexi-m?          l0-types:flexi-m

Need to check if "unique" statement is still valid when flexi-n is not present.
Esther: flexi-n if it exists must be unique in the media-channel-group upper level list.


### Review APs (action point) RFC9093-bis

#### Issue #10 "Need for frequency and power range attributes also with Standard Mode"

it seems that G.698.2 does not mandate transceivers to be tunable nor to support tunability for the whole frequency range between the
minimum and maximum frequency.
Then *it could be useful to add also to the standard mode the attributes used to report the frequency and power ranges supported by a 
given transceiver for a given application code*

**AP: @Italo @Sergio: to check off-line with Q6 experts if our understanding is correct**

#### Issue #21 "Review otu-type identities"  
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/21

**AP: @Aihua: to verify with Haomian if these otu identities are needed and where they are defined (some, but not all, are defined in G.Sup43)**

### Closed Issues Optical Impairment Topology

Closed issues from last IETF117 has been reported in the presentation during IETF118 

issue #155 "Absolute path in grouping power-param", 
issue #158 "delta-power contains a ratio in dB. one may call it gain, however gain is only positive, where delta_p could be negative. 
so the type should be changed",
issue #159 "remove from the model grouping sliceable-transponder-attributes"

All these issue solved in PR#160 https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/pull/160

### Closed Issues RFC9093-bis 

see new PR#82 https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/pull/82

-added "ratio-in-db and ratio-in-db-or-null" related to issue#158 in Optical Impairment 
-renamed decimal-16-digits and decimal-16-digits-or-null as power-spectral-density and power-spectral-density-or-null

### Optical Impairment Topology YANG model

#### #153  "Adding guideline for DGE representation"  
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/153
From IETF-118 presentation:
We model the DGE function in different way depending on their HW implementation:
-as a 2-degrees te-node terminating the OMS MCGs (traditional WSS based DGE)
-as a new OMS element, not terminating the OMS MCG (Gain Shaping equalization based DGE)
added attribute to characterize an amplifier element as "DGE"
added PDL parameter at amplifier-element level
added "delta-power" in the amplifier-element to provide  pre-emphasis different from the one provided by the ROADM
There is still debate since there are concerns on the possible limited accuracy in the noise figure of the “equivalent” amplifier i.e. 
the case of new OMS element as DGE

based on the analysis we made some proposals to solve the various exceed cases.

l0-types:power-in-dbm-or-null --> dbm-or-null
proposal: "dbm" is used just for power so no need to put power in the typedef.

We noticed that min-OSNR is wrongly defined with units "dBm", we need to change in "dB"

nominal-power-spectral-density --> nom-power-spectral-density or, since "psd" can stand for power spectral density ,
an alterantive can be --> nominal-psd 

l0-types:decimal-16-digits-or-null --> we have already changed in l0-types into "power-spectral-desnsity-or-null" 
since decimal-16-digit-or-null is used only for power spectral density. So to shorten the type --> psd-or-null

l0-types:decimal-2-digits-or-null --> dec-2-digit-or-null

l0-types:gain-in-db-or-null --> have already been changed into ratio-in-db-or-null

We agreed do not change that since more clear "ratio-in-db-or-null"
Julien/Esther: we do not risk to loose clarity in the attemt to solve problem of indentation.



#### #145 "Update Security Considerations"

Sergio uploaded to github a first draft for security section.

#### #130 "Documenting mandatory profile for OI applications"

JSON file uploaded as comment to github will be put together with the other json-examples in githug not in the draft appendix since too long.

Esther will provide a description of the various attributes that even if optional in the model, are needed for OI application. 
This attributes will be described in specifc context.
