### issues on agenda

#### OMS protection 

A new issue https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/119
has been open regarding OMS protection even if we already understood how would be the behavior of the model to support OMS protection, without modifications.

Sergio presented a few slides, created with Italo, in the view to summarize how the model already permits to address the OMS protection.
The slides have been uploaded in the github at 
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/files/10166663/optical.protection.switching-24c.pptx

slide 37: Dieter asked if the YANG code shown in the slide is already present in the teas-topo or it should be added. Sergio replied that yes, 
the code is already in the model and can be exploited in OI context.

slide 39: Based on Dieter question, Sergio clarified that the primary and secondary OMS link can be represented from OI prospective with OMS section already 
in the model.

slide 41: Gabriele observed that "combiner" was not the correct term since combiner is "combining" two entity in one while here the functionality is 
to "select" one of the two links so "selector" is the correct term.

slide 42: Gabriele observed that what in the picture even if essentially correct it is clearly one "implementation" possibility. 
For example an alternative should be do not use "splitter/selector" couple but using directly the a matrix switch (WSS) in the ROADM to split and select the traffic.

Regarding slide 39, need to check whether there could be an impact on the model to associate the two entries (red dashed line)related to LTP 1 and LTP 6, 
similar to the case of OT and OTSi protection/ROADM functions in two adjacent WDM-TE-node, see slide 31 of the package.
Maybe it can be enough to associate e.g. LTP1 as supporting OMS-protection in link-protection-type attribute.

#### Issue#118 RX power penalty 
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/118

Esther commented in github that introducing negative penalties would be not a good idea while an alternative would be to use a different referecne point 
instead of rx-channel-power-min.

Gert commented (in github and vocal) that to avoid the introduction of negative penalties we could instead define the blue curve as a simple list of 
(B2B OSNR, Rx Channel Power) values. This way, we can keep the term "rx-channel-power-min, min-OSNR" as minimum specified by the vendor as a mandatory information,
keep the list optional and leave it to the vendors to decide how detailed they would like to specify the blue curve.

To summarize, 2 alternatives on the table:

1. no need to introduce negatives penalties but instead to consider min-OSNR related to "RX-power reference point" not to the rx-channel-power-min
- Proposal: 
* to change the definition of min-OSNR , using rx-ref-channel-power  
* define new data node rx-ref-channel-power : the channel power used as reference for defining penalties and min-OSNR

2. Follow Gert's suggestion described above

Both the alternatives seems good. 
Need to check with Eliana/Enrico to valuate the two alternatives before to choose one of the two.

#### Issue#62 Multiple line codings for the same ITU-T application code  
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/62

Gert asked if there were any conclusion of the question raised on this issue regarding the answer from ITU-T with respect the issue 
to have the same application-code with more than one line-coding associated creating potential IW issue when the two ends are configured with the application code,
but e.g. one using OTL4.4-SC and the other using FOIC1.4-SC that are defined as possible alternatives for the same application code in Rec. ITU-T G.698.2 (11/2018).

Sergio said that Dieter checked internally with ITU-T Q6 expert to have some off-line feedback. The feedback was reported in
github https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/62#issuecomment-1292030115,
basically saying that G.698.2 defines optical specs for a class of optical tributary signals that can have different bit rates and line codings. 
The Reccomendation does not cover IW that instead has to be considered by the user.

No official e-mails was sent yet to ITU-T to have an offical answer to the issue.
Gert/Gabriele think that it would be better to send the e-mail (for which the text is already there in
github https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/62#issuecomment-1291955050)
to ITU-T.

None is opposing to this suggestion, but a check with CCAMP chairs need to be done to understand the liaison process.

AP @Sergio: to check with Daniele Ceccarelly how to proceed for official communication to ITU-T.
