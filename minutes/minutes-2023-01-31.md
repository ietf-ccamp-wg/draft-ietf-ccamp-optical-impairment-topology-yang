#### Issue #108 Add an Appendix to the draft describing how the YANG model supports remote optical transponders connected to a WDM-node

Italo/Sergio analysed the model against the requirement on remote transponders shelf connected to add/drop ports of a WDM-TE node.
As feedback of this analysis Sergio showed a couple of slides summarizing the basic doubts still open (see slide).

##### Summary of agreements 

About the first bullet reported in the slides related to flexi-n value there is agreement to go ahead with the first option to delete the key statements from the media-channel-group/media-channel lists, making the flexi-n attribute optional.
A possible issue without key is to have more elements with the same flexi-n and we cannot have 2 media-channel with the same flexi-n.

**AP: Italo/Aihua** to have a look to possible YANG statement (e.g.unique statement) to overcome the issue.  
 
About the second bullet in the slide,in case of inverse multiplexing , even if you have different module (pluggable) hosting TSP, they need to belong to the same TXP.  
The model is based on a 1:1 relatioship between transceiver (TSP) and OTSi and independently by different architecture the relatioship is granted.
For example Gert said yu can have some sort of electrical modulation providing mutliple-carrier and 2 transceivers with 1 single OTSi each.
No impact in the model.

*Gabriele: there can be optical modules supporting more than one transceiver (TSP), so 2 (or more) different lambdas to carry the same client payload. 
In this case each transceiver will generate/terminate one OTSi.*  

**AP: Gabriele** to reword this part based on the last discussion we had Tuesday March 31.

in other words a
Transceiver is a transmission element supporting 1 transmitter and 1 receiver for single carrier/OTSi. 
Nothing prevent in the future to have pluggable optical modules hosting more than 1 transceiver. 
No impact in the current YANG model.
Dieter: in our model we have OTSiG - OTSi realtioship that can be 1:1 or 1:N relatioship in case of inverse multiplexing.

#### Issue#122 Need clear definition of MC-e2e 
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/122

During the review of the text in the draft following issue#25 Gert raised question about the definition of E2E media channle introduced in the draft.

Italo: the model at the moment consider the e2e media-channel between transceiver.
But also NMC is between transceiver.
Italo/Dieter: we need to define clealry where are the end points. For NMC the definition of end points is clear and the end-points are on the media-ports of modulator/demodulator.

Gert: what about call this entity media-channel-trail?
Dieter: For e2e media-channel we should consider the optical port of transceiver module.
With or without filters?
NMC is considering the filter.
Gabriele: he think that the E2E media channel should be between the add/drop ports related to the edge WDM TE nodes. Not considering , 
in case of remote transponders shelf the link between remote shelf and ROADM.
Italo: in the model instead we consider the e2e MC between transceivers not only between add-drop ports,
so considering the suggestion from Gabriele would have an impact on the model.

Gert suggest we need to have a follow up about this topic during the next weekly call.



#### Issue#120 Muxponders configuration constraints 
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/120

#### Issue#25  OTSi terminology alignment with G.807 
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/25

There is an on-going PR#121 about a proposal related to the language and termonology used in the draft
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/pull/121

#### Issue#62 Multiple line codings for the same ITU-T application code  
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/62

Just as remind the issue is to have the same ITU-T application-code with more than one line-coding associated, creating potential IW issue when 
the two ends are configured with the application code -- e.g. one using OTL4.4-SC and the other using FOIC1.4-SC that are defined as possible 
alternatives for the same application code in Rec. ITU-T G.698.2 (11/2018).

An official e-mail has been sent to the ITU-T to have an offical answer related  to the issue.
