## Discussion


### Review APs (action point) 

#### AP OTSi global unique identification: Dieter to propose text
##### status: ON GOING
##### issue #88 https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/88
 

#### AP on discovery: AP @Italo  to add specific issue to clarify how the link between external shelf and ROADM is discovered
##### status: done
added issue #106 https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/106

### issues on agenda

#### Feedback from IETF-113
##### Optical Impairments Topology
The basic comment is from Robert Wilton (Cisco) who has judged our solution for "empty" type
"an overengineering" and sugested to raise the issue and question to NETMOD. 
Italo further explained that the problem we are facing is the need to distinguish the case where the 
attribute should not be reported from the case where the attribute should be reported but the value to report is unknown.

Daniele Ceccarelli suggested to raise the question to other WGs and Netmod in particular.

##### Layer0 types ext
There was general consensus to go ahead to RFC-bis .

#### issue #106 Issues with external OTs managed as independent TE nodes 
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/106

We reviewed the package uploaded by Italo about the external shelf of transponders connected to a WDM-node.
The slides shows 4 scenarios with different connectivity constraints between transponder/transceivers in the external shelf and the port degree in the WDN-node. 
For any scenarios is shown
* the physical characteristics
* single TE-node abstraction (the connectivities between transceiver output port LTP  and add/drop port LTP on WDM-node are hidden) solution 
per-TTP (all transceivers belonging to a transponder have the same connectivities towards the port of degree on the WDM-node) and 
per-transceiver (when the connectivity between transceivers belonging to a transponder and port degree on the WDM-node are different)
* 2 WDM-nodes solution

The aim of this set of slides is to go more into details when external OTs are managed as independent TE nodes and to further assess whether 
there would be issues with our model.

The conclusion of the discussion was:
* the model already owns the tool to manage these scenarios but the way to use it is not trivial.
* Need to add to the draft a description of the use cases reported in the slides and to describe how the model address them.
* Probably an Appendix of the drfat should be added for this purpose
* We can consider close this issue and in parallel open an editorial issue to describe procedure to address the scanrios described in the slides uplaoded .
* One of the issue to consider is the spectrum allocation on link bundle
* need to open another issue in the context of the L0 tunnel (both WSON and flexgrid) on how to model the mapping 
between OTSi and the related component link in case of bundle (how to report which component link is used by which OTSi)


#### issue#24 : Model alignment with 400G-ZR
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/24

* There was a common agreement that the model is already suitable for any pluggable , no needs to have a specific model to cover 400G ZR+
* ZR+ is specified in OpenROADM , and as such it can be managed as an “MSA” fora organizational mode, 
see section 2.5.2 that already mention for a as part of organizational mode case.
* We need to be sure that this MSA organizational mode can be a superset of the list of explicit attributes. 
Need to be check the list of needed parameters for ZR+ (Gabriele)
* There could be an OTN compatibility issue for ZR+ that has to be verified. 
This could be an issue in case of 3R. Not only for ZR+ we could consider the opportunity to add an attribute to provide information regarding digital compatibility.

In general:
* The model with operational modes seems providing already way to manage compatibility issues
* We should probably digging more in scenario with 3R, but also in this case seems that operational mode could be enough.
* Client information are input of path computation, and are not part of the topology model. We can suppose that other model already provided this information.
* In case of zr+ we can add sentence to specify to be careful about operational modes e.g. you could have zr+-ethernet and zr+-otn
* The way happens ODUflex ODUCn mapping is an input to path computation. Maybe operational mode could be not sufficient. 
AP @Italo to check with ITU guys.

Gabriele was out of the meeting and we decided to wait for him 
to analyse more carefully his comment on
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/24#issuecomment-1054238457 before closing eventually the issue



## next meeting: April 5th 2022
