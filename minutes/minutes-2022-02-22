## Discussion


### Review APs (action point) 

#### AP OTSi global unique identification: Dieter to propose text
##### status: ON GOING
##### issue #88 https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/88

To be addressed in the new version update for IETF 113. 

#### AP on discovery: AP @Italo  to add specific issue to clarify how the link between external shelf and ROADM is discovered
##### status: ON GOING

Italo said he will add the issue by this week.


### issues on agenda

#### Initial proposal for RFC9093-bis
Initial proposal from RFC9093-bis text merging text from RFC9093 and draft-ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-01

see https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext/blob/rfc9093-bis/draft-ietf-ccamp-rfc9093-bis.txt

#### issue#101 :Replace OMS/OTS link with OMS/OTS Media Channel Group (see: ITU-T Recommendations G.872 and G.807
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/101

**Dieter updated text/figure addressing both open issues**
#101 and #26 :Terminology: being explicit about ROADM

see https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/commit/53daa05f9eea98bc47f601bf43f8c6596ada8434

**Dieter: Section 2.3 update based on comments from @ggrammel and the related discussion in the meeting on Feb 15**

see https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/blob/I-D-09-prep/I-D_in_xml/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang-09.txt

No further comments on the modifications during the meeting. 
Gert asked to look also at figure 2 in section 2.2,and the picture seems aligned with  requested modifications. If not further comments by next call ,
we can consider close the issue. 

#### issue#102 : copropagating raman
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/102

The agreement was to add "pump-power", "frequency" and "direction" attributes as described in Gert's comment
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/102#issue-1126058417

#### AP @Esther: to check with PoliTO at TIP-OOPT-PSE WG possible description of pump-power and frequency.
##### status : on-going 

post meeting note: Esther provided the proposed description of the attributes that she sent to PoliTO for revision.

#### issue#24 : Model alignment with 400G-ZR
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/24

It has been held a meeting on the subject on Thursday 17th with the basic feedback reported in github
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/24#issuecomment-1047696081


* There was a common agreement that the model is already suitable for any pluggable , no needs to have a specific model to cover 400G ZR+
* ZR+ is specified in OpenROADM , and as such it can be managed as an “MSA” fora organizational mode, see section 2.5.2 that already mention 
"fora" as part of organizational mode case.
* We need to be sure that this MSA organizational mode can be a superset of the list of explicit attributes. 
Need to be check the list of needed parameters for ZR+ (Gabriele)
* There could be an OTN compatibility issue for ZR+ that has to be verified. This could be an issue in case of 3R.
Not only for ZR+ we could consider the opportunity to add an attribute to provide information regarding digital compatibility.

Gert commented in particular about the fourth point on compatibility and 
put the question if the model already could support case like in one end ZR+ and the other end another type tranceiver OTN compliant.

Gabriele said that in case a package could host both ZR(C-FEC) and ZR+(O-FEC) these are clearly uncompatible and would require 2 different operational modes.
But the model can already provide this capability. 
Italo raised a use case in which 2 operational modes could be different just for framing ,OTN vs Ethernet.
The question was if in this case operational modes could be enough to characterize transceiver.
Gert said in this case analog parameters are equal but digital ones. Theoretically optical path is pemitted since analog parameters are the same.
In general:
* The model with operational modes seems providing already way to manage compatibility issues
* We should probably digging more in scenario with 3R, but also in this case seems that operational mode could be enough.
* Client information are input of path computation, and are not part of the topology model. We can suppose that other model already provided this information.
* In case of zr+ we can add sentence to specify to be careful about operational modes e.g. you could have zr+-ethernet and zr+-otn
* The way happens ODUflex ODUCn mapping is an input to path computation. Maybe operational mode could be not sufficient. 
AP @Italo to check with ITU guys.
