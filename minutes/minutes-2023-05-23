### Review APs (action point) Optical Impairment Topology YANG model

####issue #124 "*Remove key from media channel list*"
related to flexi-n value there is agreement to go ahead to delete the key statements from the media-channel-group/media-channel lists, making the flexi-n attribute optional.
A possible issue without key is to have more elements with the same flexi-n and we cannot have 2 media-channel with the same flexi-n.

**AP: Italo/Aihua** to have a look to possible YANG statement (e.g.unique statement) to overcome the issue

Need to make some json examples and make the validation with yanglint.
You cannot have two media channel in the same media channel group with the same flexi-n. See figure 5 in section 2.3.4

       +--ro media-channel-groups!
       |  +--ro media-channel-group* [i]
       |     +--ro i                 int16
       |     +--ro media-channels* []
       |        +--ro flexi-n?          l0-types:flexi-n
       |        +--ro flexi-m?          l0-types:flexi-m

Need to check if "unique" statement is still valid when flexi-n is not present.
Esther: flexi-n if it exists must be unique in the media-channel-group upper level list.

####issue #110 "*Unnecessary supported-modes level*"
The issue is the usage of "container" as immediate parent of a "list" 
After the update of the model for profiling the issue has been partially resolved 

**AP: Julien** to valuate if the updated model is enough to overcome the issue

We can consider closed this issue with the updated model



### Review APs (action point) RFC9093-bis

####issue #16 "*Need to align FEC Identities*" 
We agree to add new 3 FEC type :+1: 
* SC-FEC
* oFEC
* C-FEC
We agree to delete:
* reed-solomon : since we agreed to focus only on FEC definition that are actually used for line transmission, we agreed to delete "reed-solomon" YANG identity (used for client connection)
* haming-code, golay : delete the YANG identities

* g-fec and e-fec : add correct descriptions and referecne standard (if exist)
**AP: @Gabriele to help providing possible description and standard referecne**


### Closed Issues



### Next calls



### YANG doctor review feedback

We have updated both RFC9093-bis and OI topology model 
following the YANG doctor review suggestion as indicated in the github of issue#133 https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/133
and https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/68.

Please review the two PRs #70 and #135: 
* for RFC9093-bis https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/pull/70
* for OI topology model https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/pull/135

Need to change the pmd unit in ps for drop and express path.
Esther: instead of polarization Mode dispersion we may need to use DGD (differential group delay). 
**AP:@Esther to check with PSE TIP group when discussion in are finished**.

### General discussion

#### Issue #10 Need for frequency and power range attributes also with Standard Mode
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/10

it seems that G.698.2 does not mandate transceivers to be tunable nor to support tunability for the whole frequency range between the 
minimum and maximum frequency.

Then it could be useful to add also to the standard mode the attributes used to report the frequency and power ranges supported by a given
transceiver for a given application code.

##### Discussion

let's check with  Q6 experts our understanding before any update. 

AP: @italo, @sergio to check off-line with Q6 experts 

#### Issue #3 ietf-layer0-types-ext 
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/3

it would be wise to check with Yang experts on what is the best way forward here with ietf-layer0-types-ext.

##### Discussion 

The issue is superseded by events and we can consider that as closed.

#### Issue #5 Clarification of layer0 label definitions
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/5

The layero-types defines groupings for augmenting generic TE label for layer0 (WSON and flexi-grid) but there is no description about the concept of 
layer0 label.

It may be worthwhile adding a paragraph similar to https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-ccamp-layer1-types-06#section-4.3 for layer0 labels.

See also: https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-flexigrid-yang/pull/1/files?file-filters%5B%5D=.yang#r490981902

##### Discussion

We agree that we need to add this specific section.

#### Issue #9 Guidance for unique organization-identifier
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/9

Need to provide guidance on how to make the organization-identifier unique (e.g., using an OUI or another IANA assigned registry, for further 
discussion/investigation).

##### Discussion

The possibilites are to use OUI or to use identyref to identities to be defined
in an organization specific YANG model.

Julien: Trying to have a solution supporting both options.
