### Review APs (action point) 


### Closed Issues


### Next calls
 
The next call will be next *Tuesday February 21st*, with the topic 
on the review of PR#121 https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/pull/121

#### General discussion

 
### issues on agenda
 
#### Issue #108 Add an Appendix to the draft describing how the YANG model supports remote optical transponders connected to a WDM-node

Italo/Sergio analysed the model against the requirement on remote transponders shelf connected to add/drop ports of a WDM-TE node.
As feedback of this analysis Sergio showed a couple of slides summarizing the basic doubts still open (see slide).

##### Summary of agreements 

About the first bullet reported in the slides related to flexi-n value there is agreement to go ahead with the first option to delete the
key statements from the media-channel-group/media-channel lists, making the flexi-n attribute optional.
A possible issue without key is to have more elements with the same flexi-n and we cannot have 2 media-channel with the same flexi-n.

**AP: Italo/Aihua** to have a look to possible YANG statement (e.g.unique statement) to overcome the issue.  
 
About the second bullet in the slide,in case of inverse multiplexing , even if you have different module (pluggable) hosting TSP, they need to belong to the same TXP.  
The model is based on a 1:1 relatioship between transceiver (TSP) and OTSi and independently by different architecture the relatioship is granted.
For example Gert said yu can have some sort of electrical modulation providing mutliple-carrier and 2 transceivers with 1 single OTSi each.
No impact in the model.

*Gabriele: there can be optical modules supporting more than one transceiver (TSP), so 2 (or more) different lambdas to carry the same client payload. 
In this case each transceiver will generate/terminate one OTSi.*  

**AP: Gabriele** to reword this part based on the last discussion we had Tuesday March 31.

in other words a
Transceiver is a transmission element supporting 1 transmitter and 1 receiver for single carrier/OTSi. 
Nothing prevent in the future to have pluggable optical modules hosting more than 1 transceiver. 
No impact in the current YANG model.
Dieter: in our model we have OTSiG - OTSi realtioship that can be 1:1 or 1:N relatioship in case of inverse multiplexing.

#### Issue#122 Need clear definition of MC-e2e 
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/122

A text for the definition has been proposed:
> "The E2E MC is defined in this document as a type of MC which is formed by the serial concatenation of all the MCs from source Transceiver media ports to destination transceiver media ports.
An E2E MC has to be configured across all the ROADM nodes along the E2E optical path with the same nominal central frequency n and frequency slot of width m, 
which represents the effective frequency slot of the E2E MC.
An E2E MC can carry a single OTSi, or multiple OTSi signals belonging to the same OTSiG."
see https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/122#issuecomment-1429672164

##### Discussion

The text has been agreed with a suggested change from Gert, to substitute 
>"to be configured" with "defined" so:
>
 An E2E MC is defined across all the ROADM nodes along the E2E optical path with the same nominal central frequency n and frequency slot of width m, 
 which represents the effective frequency slot of the E2E MC.
 
Need to add some text to clarify the difference between the E2E MC defined in our draft and the NMCG already defined in ITU-T G.807.

We will update the draft text with what we agreed . The issue can be considered closed.

After that we have discussed the plan in the view of IETF 116. The issue have been all clarified and no further discussion are need to clarify specific open points.

AP: Dieter/Esther/Julien to review PR#121 https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/pull/121

The outcomes of this review will be discussed during next call.

All remaining issues have the proper assigned reviewers in the view of next uploading.
The last day for uploading for next IETF is March 13th 

#### Issue#120 Muxponders configuration constraints 
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/120

The issue has been moved under flexgrid-yang repository and just left open till there will be no feedback from the discussion in the flexible grid context.


#### Issue#62 Multiple line codings for the same ITU-T application code  
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/62

Just as remind the issue is to have the same ITU-T application-code with more than one line-coding associated, creating potential IW issue when the two ends
are configured with the application code -- e.g. one using OTL4.4-SC and the other using FOIC1.4-SC that are defined as possible alternatives for the same application
code in Rec. ITU-T G.698.2 (11/2018).

An official e-mail has been sent to the ITU-T to have an offical answer related  to the issue.
