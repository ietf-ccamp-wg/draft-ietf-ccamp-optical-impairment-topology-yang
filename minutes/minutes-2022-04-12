#### issue #107 "Optical protection switching requires additional parameters "
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/107

Esther presented the scenario of Optical protection and a possible model enhancement to manage the protection.
See https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/files/8398878/Issue.for.optical.protection.switching.representation.pptx

The first question raised during the discussion was if splitter has to be considered and where is.
Two cases: Splitter is physically part of WDM-node or the Splitter is  on TXP 

Julien: only one direction is shown for convenience in the slide but the other direction is a mirror of the one shown. 

Gabriele: if the selector is an optical switch the criteria is the power,input-power. A threshold is setup due to some noise, to avoid false switching.
The power in both ports of selector is expecting to be the same.

Gabriele: The selector should belong to OLS.  
Julien: you could have both cases: selector can belong to TXP or to OLS

Gabriele: anyway the first issue raised in the slide it is not an issue
since even if TXP is outside the NW the end points are on splitter and selector

Dieter: splitter + roadm same te-node

Gabriele/Gert: 2 possibilities protection group or transceiver shadow
Gert: the wavelenght should be the same at tx and rx
Italo: OTSi 1,2 3, must be on the same frequency. 

No conclusion the issue needs more anlysis. 

Post meeting note: Gert provided an update to the slides adding the
"transceiver shadow case
" https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/files/8420961/Issue.for.optical.protection.switching.representation.2.pptx

We continued the discussion about protection.
Gert pointed out that we can have 3 and not 2 cases as mentioned in the previous MoM: 
* TXP+splitter/selector as single node
* WDM-node + splitter/selector as single node
* splitter/selector as a separate node

Dieter disagreed to have a splitter/selector as separate element.
Gert said that the real problemis not the splitter but the selector , it is an active element, only 1 OTSi is selected,how can be represented that? 
Sergio said why do not consider splitter/selector as separate element but instead consider the "contribution" provided , 
e.g. OSNR at the ADD ports of add/drop block. So adding new attribute to the list of already present ROADM add part , attributes.
Italo said we need to consider the "lifecicle" for the OTSi 1,2,3 of the drawn in slide 1. 
In the topology model we said that we need to consider the interference between new OTSi and the OTSi already in the spectrum 
but after the selector we could have OTSi 1 or 3 depending on the status of the selector and this can change. 
Path computation should verify the optical impairments in both conditions.

Gert said to take care of OTSiG as well.

AP @Italo/Sergio to summarize issues we recognize and to be addressed to model protection.

Uploaded the new version of slides with slide "for discussion".


#### issue#24 : Model alignment with 400G-ZR
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/24

* There was a common agreement that the model is already suitable for any pluggable , no needs to have a specific model to cover 400G ZR+
* ZR+ is specified in OpenROADM , and as such it can be managed as an “MSA” fora organizational mode, see section 2.5.2 that already mention 
for a as part of organizational mode case.
* We need to be sure that this MSA organizational mode can be a superset of the list of explicit attributes. 
Need to be check the list of needed parameters for ZR+ (Gabriele)
* There could be an OTN compatibility issue for ZR+ that has to be verified. 
This could be an issue in case of 3R. Not only for ZR+ we could consider the opportunity to add an attribute to provide information regarding 
digital compatibility.

In general:
* The model with operational modes seems providing already way to manage compatibility issues
* We should probably digging more in scenario with 3R, but also in this case seems that operational mode could be enough.
* Client information are input of path computation, and are not part of the topology model. We can suppose that other model already provided this information.
* In case of zr+ we can add sentence to specify to be careful about operational modes e.g. you could have zr+-ethernet and zr+-otn
* The way happens ODUflex ODUCn mapping is an input to path computation. Maybe operational mode could be not sufficient. 
AP @Italo to check with ITU guys.

Gabriele was out of the meeting and we decided to wait for him to analyse more carefully his comment on
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/24#issuecomment-1054238457 before closing eventually the issue

We went through the comment from Gabriele to understand if we can or not consider the issue closed.
Gabriele explains a bit the difference between the models 400ZR, OpenZR+. Both do not support OTN, 
as instead is supported by OpenROADM with client traffic (100-400 GbE & OTN).

We should add an attribute representing the fact that the same application code support more than 1 line-coding. 
This an an impact in case operational mode is used for transponder (same application code but possible different line coding, no interworking).
Need to define new identities in YANG to represent the different line-coding applicable to the same application code.

AP @Italo/Gabriele/Sergio need to understand how to structure the attribute 

About the list of both Transmitter Opt. spec and Receiver Opt. Spec. 
there is different opinion about the needs to includes new attributes as indicated by Gabriele:

Transmitter

* Tx output power with transmit disabled ?
* Inband (IB) OSNR ?
* Out-of-band (OOB) OSNR ?
* Transmitter polarization dependent power difference ?
* X-Y skew ?
* 
Receiver Opt. specs.

* PMD (avg) tolerance
* Peak PDL tolerance

Tx output power with transmit disabled is the case in which there is no transmit signal but noise that can have impact for crosstalk.
If you haven't filter the noise is impacting all the sprectrum.
Dieter: is it important for path computation ?
Gabriele: if you consider optical feasibility yes ?
Dieter: I have still concerns if this attribute can be used as constraints in path computation
Igor: maybe is not path computation constraints but optmization.

AP @Gabriele/Sergio to check internally with optical expert the real impact for topology model
