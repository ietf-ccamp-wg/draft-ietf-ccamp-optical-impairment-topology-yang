### Review APs (action point) Optical Impairment Topology YANG model

####issue #124 "*Remove key from media channel list*"
related to flexi-n value there is agreement to go ahead to delete the key statements from the media-channel-group/media-channel lists, 
making the flexi-n attribute optional.
A possible issue without key is to have more elements with the same flexi-n and we cannot have 2 media-channel with the same flexi-n.

**AP: Italo/Aihua** to have a look to possible YANG statement (e.g.unique statement) to overcome the issue

####issue #110 "*Unnecessary supported-modes level*"
The issue is the usage of "container" as immediate parent of a "list" 
After the update of the model for profiling the issue has been partially resolved 

**AP: Julien** to valuate if the updated model is enough to overcome the issue

### Review APs (action point) RFC9093-bis


### Closed Issues



### Next calls
next call on Tuesday, May 16


It was proposed to organize the following weekly call with an agenda addressing specific remaining issues to close. So the required "mandatory" 
participants to the meeting are the ones to which the different issues in agenda are assigned. Other possible attendees are "optional".


### YANG doctor review feedback
As required during IETF-116 presentation, a YANGdoctors review has been provided to both RFC9093-bis and OI Topology model .
Two specific issues have been added to address the answers to YANGdoctors
issues #68 https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/68 for RFC9093-bis and
issue #133 https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/133

We went through briefly the proposed replies for both YANGdoctors reviews.
People are welcome to review the proposed replies and add comments if needed. 

For OI Topology model we will update the model following the YANG doctor review suggestion as indicated in the github of
issue#133 https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/133


### General discussion

#### Issue #16 Need to align FEC Identities
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/16issue #16 

The agreement would be to stay with the three FEC as proposed in the comment
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/16#issuecomment-1508482369 .
Since the FEC types are defined in "available-fec-type" attribute that is of type identityref, nothing preclude in future new identities 
representing FEC types as soon as new standard FEC types should be proposed.
Before to close the issue we need to check YANG code if the related 3 identities for the 3 FEC types have been already defined 

##### Discussion

The check on the code has been done and new YANG identies have to be added in the model to cover the three new FEC types definitions.

About the already defined FEC types in YANG:
* g-fec and e-fec : add correct descriptions and referecne standard (if exist)
AP: @Gabriele to help providing possible description and standard referecne
* reed-solomon : since we agreed to focus only on FEC definition that are actually used for line transmission, 
we agreed to delete "reed-solomon" YANG identity (used for client connection)
* haming-code, golay : delete the YANG identities

#### Issue #56 Name for the channel spacing 
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/56

##### Discussion

There is a proposal to change the name the identity name of dwdm-ch-spc-type into a more friendly name, avoiding the usage of channe spacing since not
defined in G.694.1.
Gabriele explained the wrong assumtion is to use channel spacing in the context of flexible grid to compute Nominal centra frequency with the formula 
Frequency (THz) = 193.1 THz + n * channel spacing (THz). Channel spacing has to be used only for fixed grid.
Instead is correct to use Nominal Central Frequency Granularity in the above formula, for flexible grid NW.

##### Post meeting note: 
in our RFC9093-bis model we have two identities deinining the base type for both fixed grid and flexible grid 
* dwdm-ch-spc-type
* flexi-ch-spc-type
The name for the base identity, even if not friendly, it is correct since it uses channel spacing as in G.694.1.
The problem is for flexible grid where as well it is used "ch-spc" instead to use a name related to "nominal central frequency granularity" as indicated in G.694.1 

193.1 + n Ã— 0.00625 where n is a positive or negative integer including 0 and 0.00625 is the nominal central frequency granularity in THz

It would be more appropriate to change the name of identity base like "flexi-ncf-granularity-type" or if too long a more synthetic "flexi-ncf-gr-type" name and 
change the description where there is referecne to channel spacing instead of NCF granularity.
For backward compatiblity issue we cannot modifiy the already present definition we can aonly adding new definitions and take the actions to use in all related models 
the new definitons on behalf of the old ones.
