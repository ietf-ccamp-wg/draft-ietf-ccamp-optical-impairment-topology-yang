### Review APs (action point) Optical Impairment Topology YANG model

####issue #124 "*Remove key from media channel list*"
related to flexi-n value there is agreement to go ahead to delete the key statements from the media-channel-group/media-channel lists, making the flexi-n attribute optional.
A possible issue without key is to have more elements with the same flexi-n and we cannot have 2 media-channel with the same flexi-n.

**AP: Italo/Aihua** to have a look to possible YANG statement (e.g.unique statement) to overcome the issue

Need to make some json examples and make the validation with yanglint.
You cannot have two media channel in the same media channel group with the same flexi-n. See figure 5 in section 2.3.4

       +--ro media-channel-groups!
       |  +--ro media-channel-group* [i]
       |     +--ro i                 int16
       |     +--ro media-channels* []
       |        +--ro flexi-n?          l0-types:flexi-n
       |        +--ro flexi-m?          l0-types:flexi-m

Need to check if "unique" statement is still valid when flexi-n is not present.
Esther: flexi-n if it exists must be unique in the media-channel-group upper level list.


### Review APs (action point) RFC9093-bis

#### Issue #10 "Need for frequency and power range attributes also with Standard Mode"

it seems that G.698.2 does not mandate transceivers to be tunable nor to support tunability for the whole frequency range between the minimum and maximum frequency.
Then *it could be useful to add also to the standard mode the attributes used to report the frequency and power ranges supported by a given transceiver for a given application code*

**AP: @Italo @Sergio: to check off-line with Q6 experts if our understanding is correct**

#### Issue #21 "Review otu-type identities"  
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/issues/21

**AP: @Aihua: to verify with Haomian if these otu identities are needed and where they are defined (some, but not all, are defined in G.Sup43)**

### Closed Issues Optical Impairment Topology

Closed issues from last IETF117 has been reported in the presentation during IETF118 

issue #155 "Absolute path in grouping power-param", 
issue #158 "delta-power contains a ratio in dB. one may call it gain, however gain is only positive, where delta_p could be negative. so the type should be changed",
issue #159 "remove from the model grouping sliceable-transponder-attributes"

There is a proposal to solve these issue in PR#160 https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/pull/160

### Closed Issues RFC9093-bis 

see new PR#82 https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext-RFC9093-bis/pull/82

-added "ratio-in-db and ratio-in-db-or-null" related to issue#158 in Optical Impairment 
-renamed decimal-16-digits and decimal-16-digits-or-null as power-spectral-density and power-spectral-density-or-null

based on the analysis we made some proposals to solve the various exceed cases.

l0-types:power-in-dbm-or-null --> dbm-or-null
proposal: "dbm" is used just for power so no need to put power in the typedef.

We noticed that min-OSNR is wrongly defined with units "dBm", we need to change in "dB"

nominal-power-spectral-density --> nom-power-spectral-density or, since "psd" can stand for power spectral density , an alterantive can be --> nominal-psd 

l0-types:decimal-16-digits-or-null --> we have already changed in l0-types into "power-spectral-desnsity-or-null" since decimal-16-digit-or-null is used only for power spectral density. So to shorten the type --> psd-or-null

l0-types:decimal-2-digits-or-null --> dec-2-digit-or-null

l0-types:gain-in-db-or-null --> have already been changed into ratio-in-db-or-null

We agreed do not change that since more clear "ratio-in-db-or-null"
Julien/Esther: we do not risk to loose clarity in the attemt to solve problem of indentation.

Further thoughts from Italo , see comment https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/134#issuecomment-1822727250


#### #145 "Update Security Considerations"

Sergio uploaded to github a first draft for security section.

#### #130 "Documenting mandatory profile for OI applications"

JSON file uploaded as comment to github will be put together with the other json-examples in githug not in the draft appendix since too long.

Esther will provide a description of the various attributes that even if optional in the model, are needed for OI application. 
This attributes will be described in specifc context.





### Discussion

#### DGE guideline issue#153

Roberto made some internal check : the equipment in discussion is a two stage in-line amplifier + equalizer with not too much dynamic (max 6db). 
In this common scenario it is expected that the OSNR should have negligible variation across the spectrum and should not trigger accuracy issue in the optical simulation. 
In any case the intent is to prepare some examples OSNR calculation to confirm the above assumption. 

The point is still open since Esther is not present today at the meeting.

#### PR#160 

Added "mandatory" statement to the choice of power-param and the subtended "leaves".
See Esther's comment https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/155#issuecomment-1761502509 related to issue#155

Following the discussion related to issue#134 the name of the leaf nominal-power-spectral-density has been changed into "nominal-psd"

Comments from Roberto/Italo/Sergio 

Roberto converges on the actual proposal,but he also suggest to shorten the type of nominal-psd type, in 9093-bis module.

```             |            |   +--:(power-spectral-density)
                |           |       +--ro nominal-psd
                |           |                l0-types:power-spectral-density-or-null
into

                |           |    +--:(power-spectral-density)
                |           |       +--ro nominal-psd
                |           |                l0-types:psd-or-null```
``````



the proposal is accepted.

#### Tom Petch all comments issue#144

Issue on absolute path #155 has an impact on this issue, and also other 2 sub-issues are still open .
Dieter will check about text problem : "There are a number of TBA TBD yet to be fleshed out"
Then the security consideration has to be completed. issue#145

#### Update security Consideration

There is a text proposal update , uploaded as comment .
D. King is expecting to help the completion of the section.``````


#### Documenting mandatory profile for OI applications issue#130

JSON file sent by Esther cna be uploaded directly in the folder "json-example" in the master branch.
Dieter suggested to create a sub-folder specifically for OI-application example, with the full file, and put an extract of the full example in the main folder. 
The extract could be put in the draft as example even if not compiling.
