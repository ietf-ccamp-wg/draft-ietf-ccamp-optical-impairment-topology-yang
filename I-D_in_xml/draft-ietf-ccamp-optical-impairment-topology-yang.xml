  <section title="Introduction" anchor="sect-1">
  <t>
   In order to provision an optical connection (an optical path)
   through a wavelength switched optical networks (WSONs) or spectrum
   switched optical networks (SSONs), a combination of path continuity,
   resource availability, and impairment constraints must be met to
   determine viable and optimal paths through the network. The
   determination of appropriate paths is known as Impairment-Aware
   Routing and Wavelength Assignment (IA-RWA) <xref target="RFC6566"/>
   for WSON, while it is known as IA-Routing and Spectrum Assigment
   (IA-RSA) for SSON.
  </t>

  <t>
   This document provides a YANG data model for the impairment-aware
   Traffic Engineering (TE) topology in WSONs and SSONs. The YANG model
   described in this document is a WSON/SSON technology-specific Yang
   model based on the information model developed in
   <xref target="RFC7446"/> and the two encoding documents
   <xref target="RFC7581"/> and <xref target="RFC7579"/> that developed
   protocol independent encodings based on <xref target="RFC7446"/>.
  </t>

  <t>
   The intent of this document is to provide a YANG data model, which
   can be utilized by a Multi-Domain Service Coordinator (MDSC) to
   collect states of WSON impairment data from the Transport PNCs to
   enable impairment-aware optical path computation according to the
   ACTN Architecture <xref target="RFC8453"/>. The communication
   between controllers is done via a NETCONF <xref target="RFC8341"/>
   or a RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040"/>. Similarly,this model can
   also be exported by the MDSC to a Customer Network Controller (CNC),
   which can run an offline planning process to map latter the services
   in the network.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   It is worth noting that optical data plane interoperability is a
   complex topic especially in a multi vendor environment and usually
   requires joint engineering, which is independent from control plane
   and management plane capabilities. The YANG data model defined in
   this draft is providing sufficient information to enable optical
   impairment aware path computation.</t>
  <t> 
   Optical data plane interoperability is outside the scope of this
   draft.
  </t>

  <t>
   This document augments the generic TE topology YANG model defined
   in <xref target="RFC8795"/> where possible.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   The optical impairment aware topology for a WSON/SSON network
   based on the YANG data model defined in this document is intended to
   be used for exposing the network topology including optical
   impairments. Therefore, the topology information that is typically
   provided by a Transport PNC is assumed to be read-only (ro) data,
   i.e., not configurable (read-write). This may change when the same
   optical impairment-aware topology model is used for other use cases
   than exposing the network topology. E.g, for a path computation
   engine, where topological elements could be added in the context of
   a what-if scenario analysis. This is outside of the scope of this
   document.
  </t>

  <t>
   This document defines one YANG module: ietf-optical-impairment-
   topology (<xref target="sect-3"/>) according to the new Network
   Management Datastore Architecture <xref target="RFC8342"/>.

   device) that are modeled as a TE-node as defined in
   <xref target="RFC8795"/>, which may include a ROADM and/or multiple
   local optical transponders(OTs). Hence, a WDM-TE-node may only

  <t>
   BA (WDM-node 1) is the egress Amplifier and PA (WDM-node 2) is the
   ingress amplifier for the OMS Media Channel Group (MCG) in the
   direction from left to right in <xref target="Figure-2"/>.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   According to <xref target="G.807"/>, a Media Channel Group (MCG)
   represents "a unidirectional point-to-point management/control
   abstraction that represents a set of one or more media channels that
   are co-routed. A media channel group (MCG) is bounded by a pair of
   media ports." 
  </t>
  
  </section>

  <section title="OTS and OMS Media Channel Group" anchor="sect-2.3">
   
  <t>
   According to <xref target="G.807"/>, an
   OTS Media Channel Group (MCG) represents a topological construct
   between two adjacent amplifiers, such as:
  </t>
  
  <figure>
  <artwork><![CDATA[
  (i)  between a WDM-TE-node's BA and the adjacent ILA,
 (ii)  between a pair of ILAs,
(iii)  between an ILA and the adjacent WDM-TE-node's PA.
]]></artwork>
  </figure>
  
  <t>
   <xref target="G.807"/> defines an OMS MCG as "The topological
   relationship between the media port on a filter or coupler where a
   set of media channels are aggregated and the media port on a filter
   or coupler where one or more media channel is added to or removed 
   from that aggregate. All of the media channels that are represented
   by the OMS MCG must be carried over the same serial concatenation of
   OTS MCGs and amplifiers."
  </t>
  
  <t>
   An OMS MCG originates at the ROADM in the source WDM-node and
   terminates at the ROADM in the destination WDM-node traversing the
   Booster Amplifier (BA) and the Pre-Amplifier (PA) in the WDM-nodes
   as well as the In-Line Amplifiers (ILAs) between the two WDM-nodes.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   An OMS MCG can be decomposed into a sequence of OTS MCGs and
   amplifiers.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   An OMS MCG traverses a sequence of elements such as BA, fiber
   section, ILA, PA, and concentrated loss wherever there is an
   insertion loss caused for example by a fiber connector.
  </t>

  <t>
   In TE-topology terms, the OMS MCG is modeled as a WDM TE-link
   interconnecting two WDM-TE-nodes. A network controller can retrieve
   the optical impairment data for all the WDM TE-link elements defined
   in the layer-0 topology YANG model.
  </t>

  <t>
   The optical impairments related to the link between remote optical
   transponders, located in a different WDM-TE-node (an IP router with
   integrated optical transponders for example), can also be modeled
   as a WDM TE-link using the same optical impairments as those defined
   for a WDM TE-link between WDM-TE-nodes (OMS MCG). In this scenario,
   the node containing the remote optical transponders can be
   considered as WDM-TE-node with termination capability only and no
   switching capabilities.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   A WDM TE-link is terminated on both ends by a link termination point
   (LTP) as defined in <xref target="RFC8795"/>.
   Links between WDM nodes in optical transport networks are typically
   bidirectional.
   Generally, they have different impairments in the two directions and
   hence they have to be modeled as a pair of two unidirectional
   TE-links following the  <xref target="RFC8795"/> modeling approach.
   Unlike TE-links, which are unidirectional, the LTPs on either end
   of the TE-link pair forming the bidirectional link, are
   bidirectional as described in
   <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-te-topo-and-tunnel-modeling"/> and the
   pair of unidirectional links are connected to the same bidirectional
   LTP on either end of the link pair.
  </t>

 <section title="Optical Tributary Signal (OTSi)" anchor="OTSi">
  <t>
   The OTSi is defined in ITU-T Recommendation G.959.1, section 3.2.4
   <xref target="G.959.1"/> as "Optical signal that is placed within a 
   network media channel for transport across the optical network. This
   may consist of a single modulated optical carrier or a group of
   modulated optical carriers or subcarriers."
   
   The YANG model defined below assumes that
   a single OTSi consists of a single modulated optical carrier. This
   single modulated optical carrier conveys digital information.
   Characteristics of the OTSi signal are modulation scheme (e.g. QPSK,
   8-QAM, 16-QAM, etc.), baud rate (measure of the symbol rate), pulse
   shaping (e.g. raised cosine - complying with the Nyquist inter
   symbol interference criterion), etc.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   Path computation needs to know the existing OTSi signals for each
   OMS link in the topology to determine the optical impairment impact
   of the existing OTSi signals on the optical feasibility of a new
   OTSi signal and vice versa, i.e., the impact of the new OTSi on the
   existing OTSi signals. For determining the optical feasibility of
   the new OTSi, it is necessary to know the OTSi properties like
   carrier frequency, baud rate, and signal power for all existing
   OTSi signals on each OMS link.
  </t> 
  
  <t>  
   Additionally, it is necessary for each WDM-TE-node in the network to
   know the OTSi signals that are added to or dropped from an WDM
   TE-link (OMS MCG)link as well as the optical power of these OTSi
   signals to check whether the WDM-TE-node's optical power constraints
   are met.
  </t>

  <t>
   The optical impairment-aware topology YANG model below defines the
   OTSi properties needed for optical impairment-aware path computation
   including the spectrum occupied by each OTSi signal. The model also
   defines a pointer (leafref) from the OTSi to the transceiver module
   terminating the OTSi signal.   
  </t>
  
  <t>
   The OTSi signals in the YANG model are described by augmenting the
   network and each OTSi signal is uniquely identified by its
   otsi-carrier-id, which is unique within the scope the OTSiG [see
   <xref target="OTSiG" /> below] the OTSi belongs to.
  </t>

  </section>

  <section title="Optical Tributary Signal Group (OTSiG)"
  anchor="OTSiG">
  <t>
   The OTSiG is defined in ITU-T Recommendation G.807
   <xref target="G.807"/> as a "set of optical tributary signals (OTSi)
   that supports a single digital client".
   Hence, the OTSiG is an electrical signal that is carried by one or
   more OTSi's. The relationship between the OTSiG and the the OTSi's
   is described in <xref target="G.807"/>, section 10.2.
   The YANG model below supports both cases: the single OTSi case
   where the OTSiG contains a single OTSi (see <xref target="G.807"/>,
   Figure 10-2) and the multiple OTSi case where the OTSiG consists of
   more than one OTSi (see <xref target="G.807"/>, Figure 10-3).
   From a layer 0 topology YANG model perspective, the OTSiG is a
   logical construct that associates the OTSi's, which belong to the
   same OTSiG. The typical application of an OTSiG consisting of more
   than one OTSi is inverse multiplexing. Constraints exist for the
   OTSi's belonging to the same OTSiG such as: (i) all OTSi's must be
   co-routed over the same optical fibers and nodes and (ii) the
   differential delay between the different OTSi's may not exceed a
   certain limit. Example: a 400Gbps client signal may be carried by 4
   OTSi's where each OTSi carries 100Gbps of client traffic.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   All OTSiGs are described in the YANG model by augmenting the network
   and each OTSiG is uniquely identified by its otsi-group-id, which is
   unique within the network. Each OTSiG also contains a list of the
   OTSi signals belonging to the OTSiG.

   <xref target="G.807"/> defines a "media channel" as "A media
   association that represents both the topology (i.e., the path
   through the media) and the resource (i.e., frequency slot or
   effective frequency slot) that it occupies." In this document,
   the term "channel" is occasionally used to indicate the resource
   of an MC (i.e., frequency slot or effective frequency slot),
   without representing topology.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   In this document, an end-to-end MC is defined as a type of MC,
   which is formed by the serial concatenation of all the MCs from
   source Transceiver media ports to destination transceiver media
   ports.
   This end-to-end MC is defined across all the ROADM nodes along the
   end-to-end optical path with the same nominal central frequency n
   and frequency slot of width m, which represents the effective
   frequency slot of the end-to-end MC.
   An end-to-end MC can carry a single OTSi, or multiple OTSi signals
   belonging to the same OTSiG.
  </t>

  <t>
   <xref target="G.807 Amd1"/> defines a "network media channel (NMC)"
   as "a type of media channel that is formed by the serial
   concatenation of all media channels between the media port of a
   modulator and the media port of a demodulator". The modulator and
   demodulator are integral functions of a transceiver and their media
   ports do not necessarily coincide with the media port of the 
   transceiver, which is associated with the transceiver's physical
   optical port. Due to this difference, the end-to-end MC is defined
   above and is used in this document.
  </t>

  <t>
   In section <xref target="Prot"/>, the term "end-to-end MC path" is
   used to describe the topological aspect of the end-to-end MC, i.e.,
   the path through the media (see: <xref target="G.807 Amd1"/>,
   section 7.1.2). This is in line with the TE path defined in
   <xref target="RFC8795"/>, section 3.9, where the TE path is defined
   as "an ordered list of TE links and/or TE nodes on the TE topology
   graph" interconnecting a pair of tunnel termination points (TTPs).

   The frequency slot of the MC is defined by the n value defining the
   central frequency of the MC and the m value that defines the width
   of the MC following the flexible grid definition in
   <xref target="G.694.1"/>. In this model, the effective frequency
   slot as defined in <xref target="G.807"/> is equal to the frequency
   slot of this MC. It is also assumed that ROADM devices
   can switch MCs.
   For various reasons (e.g. differential delay), it is preferred to
   use a single MC for all OTSi's of the same OTSiG. It may however not
   always be possible to find a single MC for carrying all OTSi's of an
   OTSiG due to spectrum occupation along the OTSiG path.

  <section title="Media Channel Group (MCG)" anchor="sect-2.3.4">

   ITU-T [G.807] defines the Media Channel Group MCG as
   "A unidirectional point to point management/control abstraction

   The YANG model below assumes
   that the MCG is a logical grouping of one or more MCs that are used

  <t>
   The MCG can be considered as an association of MCs without defining
   a hierarchy where each MC is defined by its (n,m) value pair. An MCG
   consists of more than one MC when no single MC can be found from
   source to destination that is wide enough to accommodate all OTSi's
   (modulated carriers) that belong to the same OTSiG. In such a case
   the set of OTSi's belonging to a single OTSiG have to be split

  <section title="Optical Amplifiers" anchor="optical_amps">
  <t>
   Optical amplifiers are used in WDM networks for amplifying the
   optical signal in the optical domain without any optical to
   electrical and electrical to optical conversion. Three
   main optical amplifier technologies are existing today:
   
   <ul spacing="compact">
     <li>Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifiers (EDFAs)</li>
     <li>Raman Amplifiers</li>   
     <li>Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers (SOAs)</li>
   </ul>
  </t>

  <t> 
   In today's WDM networks EDFAs and Raman amplifiers are widely used.
   Raman amplifiers have become attractive due to their large spectral
   gain bandwidth, which can be quite flat, with similar or even lower
   noise figures compared to EDFAs. On the other hand, Raman amplifiers
   consume more power and are usually more expensive than EDFAs.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   Raman amplifiers are distributed amplifiers where an optical pump
   signal is injected typically in opposite direction to the optical
   signal that is amplified (backward pump, counter-propagating pump
   light). Injecting the optical pump signal in the same direction is
   also possible (forward pump, co-propagating pump light).
   For optical amplifiers, the YANG model defines Raman pump light
   attributes describing the direction (raman-direction) with respect
   to the signal that is amplified and optical frequency and power for
   the pump light source(s) contained in the raman-pump list. These   
   Raman amplifier-specific attributes are optional as they are only
   applicable to Raman amplifiers. For determining the optical
   amplifier type, i.e., to figure out whether an optical amplifier is
   a Raman amplifier, the type-variety attribute is used.
   Due to the distributed nature of the Raman amplifier it is difficult
   to clearly separate the amplifier from the fiber span into which the
   pump signal is injected. From a topology modeling perspective, the
   Raman amplifier is modeled as two OMS line elements:
  </t>
  
  <t>
    <list style="numbers"><?rfc subcompact="yes"?>
      <t>
       a passive fiber element accounting for the fiber loss only
       and not the resulting loss including the Raman gain</t>
      <t>
       an amplifier element providing all optical amplifier properties
       (gain, tilt, etc.). On the OMS-link, the amplifier element is
       placed where the pump is located and the geolocation information
       also indicates the location of the pump.
      </t>
    <?rfc subcompact="no"?>
    </list>
  </t>
  
  <t>
   Amplifiers can be classified according to their location along the
   TE-link (OMS MCG). There are three basic amplifier types: In-Line
   Amplifiers (ILAs), Pre-Amplifiers and Booster Amplifiers. ILAs are
   separate physical devices while Pre-Amplifiers and Booster
   Amplifiers are integral elements of a WDM-node. From a data modeling
   perspective, node-internal details should not be modeled and should
   be abstracted as much as possible. For Pre-Amplifiers and Booster
   Amplifiers, however, a different approach has been taken and they
   are modeled as TE-link elements as they have the same optical
   impairments as ILAs.
  </t>

  <t>
   ILAs may have a variable optical attenuator on the ingress side
   (in-voa attribute) allowing to control the input power of the WDM
   signal (OMS MCG) entering the gain stage of the ILA. It may also
   have a variable optical attenuator on the egress side, which allows
   to control the optical power of the WDM output signal (OMS MCG) of
   the ILA. The actual-gain attribute reflects the gain of the ILA gain
   stage and does not include the attenuation of the in-voa and/or
   out-voa.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   To support the modeling of multi-band (e.g., C + L band) and
   multi-stage (cascaded) amplifiers as depicted in
   <xref target="multi-band_multi-stage_amp"/>, the OMS element that
   describes an optical amplifier may contain an unordered list of
   amplifier-elements. The position of the element is based on the
   following attributes:
  </t>
  <t>
   <ul spacing="compact">
     <li>
       lower-frequency and upper-frequency describing the frequency
       band the set of amplifier-elements are operating in.
     </li>
     <li>
       stage-order describing the sequential order of the cascaded
       amplifier-elements for the frequency band.
     </li>   
   </ul>
  </t>
  
  <t>
   The detailed representation of the amplifier stages is not always
   mandatory. Abstraction is allowed as long as the optical impairments
   of the multi-stage amplifier are modeled properly.
   For example, the detailed representation of the cascaded elements is
   needed in case the amplifier supports both amplification of the
   signal as well as the DGE function described in
   <xref target="DGE_subsection"/>.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   Multi-band amplifiers like the dual-band amplifier depicted in
   <xref target="multi-band_multi-stage_amp"/> have a band-separating
   filter at the input and a band-combining multiplexer combining all
   the bands at the output. This filter and multiplexer functions are
   not modeled explicitly and their optical impairments are subsumed
   in the optical impairments of the amplifier components.

   ILAs are placed at locations where the optical amplification of the

   Geolocation information is already defined for TE nodes in

   One modeling consideration of the ROADM internal is to model power

  <t>
   [Editor's note: The relationship between the transponder and the
   OTSi in the YANG model described in <xref target="sect-3"></xref>
   needs further clarification and refinement.]
  </t>

  <t>
   A Transponder is the element that sends and receives the optical
   signal from a DWDM network. A transponder can comprise one or more
   transceivers. A transceiver represents a transmitter/receiver
   (Tx/Rx) pair as defined in ITU-T Recommendation G.698.2
   <xref target="G.698.2"/>. In addition to the transceiver, which is
   terminating an OTSi signal, a transponder typically provides
   additional layer 1 functionality like for example aggregation
   (multiplexing) of client layer signals, which is outside the scope
   of this document addressing layer 0 aspects of transponders.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   The termination of an OTSi signal by a transceiver is modeled as a
   function of the tunnel termination point (TTP) as defined in
   <xref target="RFC8795"/>.
   Due to the fact that optical transport services (TE tunnels) are
   typically bidirectional, a TTP is also modeled as a bidirectional
   entity like the LTP described above. Moreover, a TTP can terminate
   one or several OTSiG signals (tunnels) as described in
   <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-te-topo-and-tunnel-modeling"/> and each
   OTSiG consists of one or multiple OTSi signals as described in
   <xref target="OTSiG"/>.
   Therefore, a TTP may be associated with multiple transceivers.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   A transponder is typically characterized by its data/symbol rate
   and the maximum distance the signal can travel. Other transponder
   properties are: carrier frequency for the optical channels,
   output power per channel, measured input power, modulation scheme,
   FEC, etc.
  </t>

  <t>
   From a path computation perspective, the selection of the compatible
   configuration of the source and the destination transceivers is an
   important factor for optical signals to traverse through the DWDM
   network.

   A Transponder is the element that sends and receives the optical
   signal from a fiber. A transponder is typically characterized by its
   data rate and the maximum distance the signal can travel. Channel
   frequency, per channel input power, FEC and Modulation are also
   associated with a transponder. From a path computation point of
   view, the selection of the compatible source and destination
   transponders is an important factor for optical signal to traverse
   through the fiber. There are three main approaches to determine
   optical signal compatibility. Application Code based on G.698.2
   <xref target="G.698.2"/> is one approach that only checks the code
   at both ends of the link. Another approach is organization codes
   that are specific to an organization or a vendor. The third approach
   is specify all the relevant parameters explicitly, e.g., FEC type,
   Modulation type, etc.

  <section title="Standard Modes" anchor="sect-2.5.1">
  <t>
   A standard mode is related to an optical specification developed
   by an SDO organization. Currently, the "Standard Modes" can only
   be referred to ITU-T G.698.2 <xref target="G.698.2"/> since G.698.2
   is the only specification defining "Standard Modes" today.
   Nothing is precluding, however, to consider other specifications
   provided by any other SDO in the Standard Mode context as soon as
   such sepcifications will be available. An application code as
   defined in ITU-T G.698.2 <xref target="G.698.2"/> is representing
   a standard ITU-T G.698.2 optical interface specification towards
   the realization of transversely compatible DWDM systems.
   Two transceivers supporting the same application code and a line
   system matching the constraints, defined in ITU-T G.698.2, for that
   application code will interoperate. As the characteristics are
   encoded in the application code, the YANG model in this document

  </t>
  
  <t>
   An organizational mode is identified by the organization-identifier
   attribute defining the scope and an operational-mode that is
   meaningful within the scope of the organization. Hence, the two
   attributes must always be considered together. It is the
   responsibility of the organization to assign operational modes and
   to ensure that operational modes are unique and unambiguous within
   the scope of the organization.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   Two transceivers can be interconnected, if they have at least one
   (organization-identifier, operational-mode) pair in common and if
   the supported carrier frequency and power attributes have a matching
   range. This is a necessary condition for path computation in the
   context of organizational modes.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   An operational mode is a transceiver preset (a configuration with
   well-defined parameter values) subsuming several transceiver
   properties defined by the optical interface specification - these
   properties are not provided for an operational mode and are
   therefore not defined in the YANG model. Examples of these
   properties are:
  </t>

  <t><list style="symbols"><?rfc subcompact="yes"?>
    <t>FEC type</t>
    <t>Modulation scheme</t>
    <t>Encoding (mapping of bit patterns (code words) to symbols in the
       constellation diagram)</t>
    <t>Baud rate (symbol rate)</t>
    <t>Carrier bandwidth (typically measured in GHz)</t>
    <?rfc subcompact="no"?>
  </list></t>
  
  <t>
   The major reason for these transceiver presets is the fact that the
   attribute values typically cannot be configured independently and
   are therefore advertised as supported operational mode capabilities.
   It is the responsibility of the organization to assign operational
   modes and to ensure that operational modes are unique and not
   ambiguous within the scope of the organization.
  </t>

  <t>
   In addition to the transceiver properties subsumed by the
   operational mode, optical power and carrier frequency related
   properties are modeled separately, i.e., outside of the operational
   mode. This modeling approach allows transponders using different
   transceiver variants (e.g. optical modules) with slightly different
   power and/or frequency range properties to interoperate without
   defining separate operational modes. Different optical modules
   (pluggables) from different suppliers typically have slightly
   different input and output power ranges or may have slightly
   different carrier frequency tuning ranges.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   The received channel power and the received total power are two
   parameters that can be measured by the receiver and can be provided
   by the transceiver in order to allow a controller to determine the
   expected performance of the end-to-end service taking into account
   the optical impairments along the path.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   An organization may define the operational modes to include the
   optical power and carrier frequency related properties following the
   application code approach as defined in ITU-T Recommendation G.698.2
   <xref target="G.698.2"/>. In such a case, the explicit optical power
   and carrier frequency related optional attributes shall be omitted
   in order to avoid redundant information in the description of the
   transceiver capabilities. If these attributes are provided in
   addition to the operational modes including these attribute values
   implicitly, the parameter values provided explicitly replace the
   implicit values and take precedence. This shall, however, only be
   an done in exceptional cases and shall be avoided whenever possible.
   In case an implicitly given range is extended utilizing the explicit
   optional attributes, a path computation policy rule may be applied
   to select a value preferably from the range defined implicitly and
   to only select a value from the extended range if no path can be
   found for values in the implicitly defined range. Path computation
   policy is outside the scope of this topology YANG model.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   In summary, the optical power and carrier frequency related
   attributes shall either be described implicitly by the operational
   mode following the definition provided by that organization or shall
   be described explicitly when the optical power and carrier frequency
   related properties are not included in the operational mode
   definition.
  </t>
  
  </section>

  <section title="Explicit Modes" anchor="sect-2.5.3">
  <t>
   The explicit mode allows to encode, explicitly, any subset of
   parameters e.g., FEC type, Modulation type, etc, to enable a
   controller entity to check for interoperability by means outside
   of this draft. It shall be noted that using the explicit encoding
   does not guarantee interoperability between two transceivers even
   in case of identical parameter definitions. The explicit mode
   shall therefore be used with care, but it could be useful when no
   common Application Codes or Organizational Modes exist or the
   constraints of common Application Codes or Organizational Modes
   cannot be met by the line system.

  <section title="Transponder Capabilities and Current Configuration"

  <t>
   The YANG model described in <xref target="sect-3"/> defines the

  </list></t>
  
  <t>
   The transceiver capabilities are described by the set of modes the
   transceiver is supporting. Each mode MUST follow only one of the
   three mode options defined above (choice in the YANG model). The
   YANG model allows to describe the transceiver capabilities by mixing
   different modes. A transceiver may support some ITU-T application
   codes and in addition some organizational or explicit modes.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   A transceiver mode description comprises the following properties:
  </t>
  
  <t><list style="symbols"><?rfc subcompact="yes"?>
   <t>Supported transmitter tuning range with min/max nominal carrier
      frequency [f_tx_min, f_tx_max]</t>

  <?rfc subcompact="no"?>

  <t>
   These optical transceiver properties are explicitly defined in the
   model for explicit and organizational modes, while they are
   implicitly defined for the application codes (see ITU-T G698.2
   <xref target="G.698.2"/>).
  </t>
  
  <t>
   The set of optical impairment limits, e.g., min OSNR, max PMD,
   max CD, max PDL, Q-factor limit, are explicitly defined for the
   explicit modes while they are  defined implicitly for the
   application codes and organizational modes.
  </t>

   It is possible that the set of parameter values defined for an

  <section title="3R Regenerators" anchor="sect-2.6">
  
  <t>
   Optical transponders are usually used to terminate a layer 0 tunnel
   (layer 0 service) in the WDM layer. If, however, no optical path can
   be found from the source transponder to the destination transponder
   that is optically feasible due to the optical impairments, one or
   more 3R regenerators are needed for regenerating the optical signal
   in intermediate nodes. The term "3R" regenerator means:
   reamplification, reshaping, retiming. As described in
   <xref target="G.807"/>, Appendix IV, a 3R regenerator terminates the
   OTSi and generates a new OTSi. Depending on the 3R regenerator
   capabilities, it can provide functions such as carrier frequency
   translation (carrier-frequency), changes in the modulation scheme
   (modulation-type) and FEC (FEC-type) while passing through the
   digital signal except the FEC (the FEC is processed and errors are
   corrected).
  </t>

  <t>
   The 3R regeneration compound function is illustrated in section 10.1
   of <xref target="G.798.1"/>, and sections 10.3 and 10.4 provide
   examples of a ROADM architecture and a photonic cross-connect
   architecture including 3R regenerators.
   Based on the provided functionality, 3R regenerators are considered
   as topological layer 0 entities because they are needed for layer 0
   path computation in case the optical impairments make it impossible
   to find an optically feasible end-to-end path from the source
   transponder to the destination transponder without 3R regeneration.
   When an end-to-end path includes one or more 3R regenerators, the
   corresponding layer 0 tunnel is subdivided into 2 or more segments
   between the source transponder and the destination transponder
   terminating the layer 0 tunnel.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   3R regenerators are usually realized by a pair of optical
   transponders, which are described in <xref target="transponders"/>
   above. If a pair of optical transponders is used to perform a 3R
   regeneratator function, two different configurations are possible
   involving the pair of optical transceivers of the two optical
   transponders:
  </t>

  <t><list style="symbols">
   <t>
    The two transponders can be operated in a back-to-back
    configuration where  the transceiver of each optical transponder
    receives and transmits the  optical signal from/to the same segment
    of the end-to-end tunnel. This means that each transceiver is
    operated in a bi-directional mode.

    The two transponders can be operated in a configuration where each
    transponder performs the 3R regeneration function in one direction,
    one in forward direction (from source to destination) and the other
    in the reverse direction. In this configuration, the transceiver of
    each optical transponder receives the signal from one segment and
    transmits the regenerated optical signal into the adjacent segment.
    This configuration is also called cross-regeneration and each

   Due to the fact that 3R regenerators are composed of an optical
   transponder pair, the capability whether an optical transponder can
   be used as a 3R regenerator is is added to the transponder
   capabilities. Hence, no additional entity is required for describing
   3R regenerators in the TE-topology YANG model. The optical
   transponder capabilities regarding the 3R regenerator function are
   described by the following two YANG model attributes:
  </t>

  <t><list style="symbols"><?rfc subcompact="yes"?>
  <t>supported-termination-type</t>
  <t>supported-3r-mode</t>
  <?rfc subcompact="no"?>
  </list></t>

  <t>
   The supported-termination-type attribute describes whether the
   optical transponder can be used as tunnel terminating transponder
   only, as 3R regenerator only, or whether it can support both
   functions. The supported-3r-mode attribute describes the
   configuration of the transponder pair forming the 3R regenerator
   as described above.

   WSS separates the incoming light input spectrally as well as
   spatially, then chooses the wavelength that is of interest by
   deflecting it from the original optical path and then couple it to
   another optical fibre port. WSS/Filter is internal to ROADM. So this
   document does not model the inside of ROADM.

   There are various optical fiber types defined by ITU-T. There are
   several fiber-level parameters that need to be factored in, such as,
   fiber-type, length, loss coefficient, pmd, connectors (in/out).
  </t>
  
  <t>
   The loss of a fiber span can be described in two ways: it should be
   described by specifying the loss coefficient (loss-coef) of the
   fiber type and the length of the fiber as well as the total-loss
   attribute when the loss can be measured with an egress amplifier
   power measurement facility (power measured at the output of the
   egress amplifier = input of the fiber span) and an ingress amplifier
   power measurement facility (power measured at the input of the
   ingress amplifier in the next node = output of the fiber span).
   This measured loss typically differs from the calculated loss based
   on loss-coef and length as it includes all loss contributions
   including possible accumulated loss due to imperfect fiber splices
   and connector losses. In case the total-loss cannot be measured (no
   power measurement facilities in place), this optional attribute

   The TE topology YANG model augmentations including optical

   3 categories of WDM-node architectures listed above. In the case
   of a disaggregated WDM-node architecture, it is assumed that the
   optical domain controller already performs some form of abstraction
   and presents the WDM-TE-node representing the disaggregated WDM-node
   in the same way as an integrated WDM-TE-node with local optical
   transponders if the optical transponder subsystems and the add/drop
   subsystems are collocated (short fiber links not imposing any

   <xref target="Figure-2"/> and <xref target="Figure-6"/> below show
   the typical architecture of an integrated WDM-node, which contains
   the optical transponders as an integral part of the WDM-node. Such
   an integrated WDM-node provides DWDM interfaces as external
   interfaces for interconnecting the device with its neighboring
   WDM-node (see OMS MCG above). The number of these interfaces denote
   also the degree of the WDM-node. A degree 3 WDM-node for example has
   3 DWDM links that interconnect the WDM-node with 3 neighboring
   WDM-nodes. Additionally, the WDM-node provides client interfaces for
   interconnecting the WDM-node with client devices such as IP routers
   or Ethernet switches. These client interfaces are the client
   interfaces of the integrated optical transponders.

   <xref target="Figure-7"/> below shows the extreme case where all
   optical transponders are not integral parts of the WDM-node but are
   separate devices that are connected to the add/drop ports of the
   WDM-node. If the optical transponders and the WDM-node are

   interconnect the optical transponders with an add/drop port of the

   however, the optical impairments of the single channel fiber link
   between the optical transponder and the add/drop port of the
   WDM-node cannot be neglected, it is necessary to represent the
   fiber link with its optical impairments in the topology model This

  <section title="Disaggregated WDM-TE-node Subdivided into Degree,
   Add/Drop, and Optical Transponder Subsystems" anchor="sect-2.9.3">
  
  <t>
   Recently, some DWDM network operators started demanding WDM
   subsystems from their vendors. An example is the OpenROADM project
   where multiple operators and vendors are developing related YANG
   models. The subsystems of a disaggregated WDM-TE-node are:
  </t>
  
    <t>
    <list style="symbols"><?rfc subcompact="yes"?>
      <t>Single degree subsystems</t>
      <t>Add/drop subsystems</t>
      <t>Optical transponder subsystems</t>
    <?rfc subcompact="no"?>
    </list>
  </t>
  
  <t>
   These subsystems are separate network elements and each network
   element provides a separate management and control interface. The
   subsystems are typically interconnected using short fiber patch
   cables and form together a disaggregated WDM-TE-node. This
   disaggregated WDM-TE-node architecture is depicted in
   <xref target="Figure-8"/> below.
  </t>

  <t>
   As this document defines TE topology YANG model augmentations
   <xref target="RFC8795"/> for the TE topology YANG
   model provided at the north-bound interface of the optical domain
   controller, it is a valid assumption that the optical domain
   controller abstracts the subsystems of a disaggregated WDM-TE-node
   and presents the disaggregated WDM-TE-node in the same way as an
   integrated WDM-node hiding all the interconnects that are not
   relevant from an external TE topology view.

  <section title="Optical Impairments Imposed by WDM-TE-Nodes"
   anchor="sect-2.9.4">
  
  <t>
   [Editor's note: the following text still needs to be updated based
   on the agreed terminology]
  </t>
  
  <t>
   When an optical OTSi signal traverses a ROADM node, optical
   impairments are imposed on the signal by various passive or active
   optical components inside the ROADM node. Examples of optical
   impairments are:
  </t>
  
  <t><list style="symbols"><?rfc subcompact="yes"?>
   <t>Chromatic dispersion (CD)</t>
   <t>Polarization mode dispersion (PMD)</t>
   <t>Polarization dependent loss (PDL)</t>
   <t>Optical amplifier noise due to amplified spontaneous emission
   (ASE)</t>
   <t>In-band cross-talk</t>
   <t>Filtering effects (for further study)</t>
  <?rfc subcompact="no"?>
  </list></t>
  
  <t>
   A ROADM node contains a wavelength selective photonic switching
   function (WSS)that is capable of switching media channels (MCs)
   described in <xref target="sect-2.3.4"/>. These MCs can be
   established between two line ports of the ROADM or between a line
   port and an Add/Drop port of the ROADM. The Add/Drop ports of a
   ROADM are those ports to which optical transponders are connected.
   Typically, add/drop ports deal with a single channel signal (single
   OTSi), but principally this could also be a group  of OTSi signals
   (OTSiG). The optical impairments associated with these MCs are
   different and the paths of the MCs inside the ROADM node can be
   categorized as follows:
  </t>
  
  <t><list style="symbols"><!-- <?rfc subcompact="yes"?> -->
  <t>Express path: MC path between two line ports of the ROADM
    (unidirectional)</t>
  <t>Add Path: MC path from an Add port to a line port of the ROADM</t>
  <t>Drop path: MC path from a line port to a Drop port of the ROADM
  </t>
  <!-- <?rfc subcompact="no"?> -->
  </list></t>
  
  <t>
   Due to the symmetrical architecture of the ROADM node, the optical
   impairments associated with the express path are typically the same
   between any two line ports of the ROADM whereas the optical
   impairments for the add and drop paths are different and therefore
   have to be modeled separately.
  </t>
 
  <t>
   The optical impairments associated with each of the three types of
   ROADM-node-internal paths described above are modeled as optical
   impairment parameter sets. These parameter sets are modeled as an
   augmentation of the te-node-attributes defined in
   <xref target ="RFC8795"/>.
   The te-node-attributes are augmented with a list of
   roadm-path-impairments for the three ROADM path types distinguished
   by the impairment-type. Each roadm-path-impairments list entry
   contains the set of optical impairment parameters for one of the
   three path types indicated by the impairment-type. For the optical
   feasibility calculation based on the optical impairments, it is
   necessary to know whether the optical power of the OTSi stays within
   a certain power window. This is reflected by some optical power
   related parameters such as loss parameters or power parameters,
   which are included in the optical impairment parameter sets (see
   tree view in <xref target="sect-3"/>).
  </t>
  
  <t>
   <xref target ="RFC8795"/> defines a connectivity
   matrix and a local link connectivity list for the TE node. The
   connectivity matrix describes the connectivity for the express paths
   between the different lines of the ROADM and the local link
   connectivity list describes the connectivity for the Add and Drop
   paths of the ROADM. These matrices are augmented with a new
   roadm-path-impairment matrix element, an add-path-impairment, and
   drop-path-impairment matrix element, respectively, which are defined
   as a pointer to the corresponding entry in the
   roadm-path-impairments list (leaf-ref).

  <section title="Optical Protection Architectures" anchor="Prot">
  
  <t>
   The YANG model defined in this document supports the following
   optical protection architectures:
  </t>
 
  <t>
    <ul>
      <li>Individual OTSi protection</li>
      <li>OMS MCG protection = TE-link protection between adjacent
          WDM-TE-nodes</li>
    </ul>
  </t>

 
  <section title="Individual OTSi Protection" anchor="OTSi_prot">
  
  <t>
   Individual OTSi protection is a protection architecture where an
   individual OTSi signal is protected as described in Appendix III of
   ITU-T Recommendation G.873.1 <xref target ="G.873.1"/>. 
   This protection architecture requires dedicated photonic protection
   functions in the optical domain that are typically provided by
   dedicated protection hardware. These photonic protection functions
   are a photonic splitter function splitting the OTSi signal in
   transmit direction and a photonic selector function selecting the
   OTSi signal in receive direction from one of the two protection
   legs between the two protection functions terminating the individual
   OTSi protection.
   This individual OTSi protection scheme can be considered as a
   photonic 1+1 protection scheme (1+1 sub-network connection
   protection (SNCP) in ITU-T terminology).
  </t>
  
  <t>
   In order to achieve short protection switching times, it is
   necessary that the OTSi signals of the two legs are identical in
   terms of wavelength, modulation format, FEC, etc., which means no
   receiver configuration changes when a protection switch at the
   selector occurs selecting the other leg. This is important when 3R
   regenerators are needed between the two end-points terminating the
   protected segment, which typically is end-to-end.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   In case of individual OTSi protection without 3R regenerators,
   two end-to-end MC paths are associated with the OTSi signal. In the
   YANG model, this is modeled as leaf list of the otsi providing the
   e2e-mc-path-id for the two end-to-end MC paths associated with the
   individually 1+1 protected OTSi. This scenario is depicted in
   <xref target="OTSi_prot_no_3R_fwd"/> (forward direction) and
   <xref target="OTSi_prot_no_3R_rev"/> (reverse direction)below.
  </t>
  
<!--<t>
   Note: Where several WDM nodes are involved, the links between WDM
   nodes in the figures below illustrating  the various protection
   architectures are drawn as bi-directional links (arrows on both ends
   of the dashed line) for the sake of simplification.
   Physically, all links in WDM networks are uni-directional and there
   is a fiber link in forward and a fiber link in reverse direction.
   WDM services are typically bi-directional and the same media channel
   is used on the links in both directions.
   The splitter function of the combined splitter/selector is always
   located on the upstream side whereas the selector function is always
   located on the downstream side in the two directions.

   If a 3R regenerator is crossed on one of the two legs or even on
   both legs, the end-to-end MCs are terminated on both sides of the
   3R regenerator. The configured-termination-type attribute set to
   "3r-regeneration" shall be used to indicate that the transceivers
   are forming a 3R regenerator instead of terminating the layer 0
   tunnel (layer 0 service).
   At WDM-nodes containing a 3R regenerator, the end-2-end MCs are
   stitched together forming the end-to-end path for the layer 0 tunnel
   (layer 0 service). This is reflected in the leaf list of the OTSi,
   which now lists all e2e-mc-path-ids of the end-to-end MC paths on
   the two legs of the individually 1+1 protected OTSi signal.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   In the scenario depicted in <xref target="OTSi_prot_with_3R_fwd"/>
   and <xref target="OTSi_prot_with_3R_rev"/> below where a 3R
   regenerator is crossed in WDM Node6 on the lower leg, the
   e2e-mc-path-id leaf list has 3 entries (assumption: the same
   e2e-mc-path-id can be used for the path in forward and reverse
   direction):
   
   <ol>
     <li>
       The e2e-mc-path-id identifying end-to-end MC path1 from WDM
       Node1 via WDM Node3 and WDM Node4 to WDM Node2 as well as
       end-to-end MC path1' in reverse direction (upper leg)
     </li>
     <li>
       The e2e-mc-path-id identifying end-to-end MC path2 from WDM
       Node1 via WDM Node5 to WDM Node6 containing the 3R regenerator
       as well as end-to-end MC path2' in reverse direction (left
       hand segment of the lower leg)
     </li>
     <li>
       The e2e-mc-path-id identifying end-to-end MC path3 from WDM
       Node6 containing the 3R regenerator via WDM Node7 to WDM
       Node2 as well as end-to-end MC path3' in reverse direction
       (right hand segment of the lower leg)
     </li>
   </ol>

   Based on this modeling approach it is possible to identify the
   end-2-end MCs stitched together at 3R regenerators on each of the
   two legs of the individually protected 1+1 OTSi signal. Like for
   the case without 3R regenerators is also possible to associate
   two end-to-end paths in forward and reverse direction for the two
   legs between the optical transponders terminating the individually
   1+1 protected OTSi in WDM Node1 and WDM Node2, respectively:
   
   <ol spacing="compact">
     <li>end-to-end MC path1 and end-to-end MC path1' (upper leg)</li>
     <li>
       end-to-end MC path2 and end-to-end MC path2' stitched together
       with end-to-end MC path3 and end-to-end MC path3' (lower leg)
     </li>

    </ol>
  
  <t>
   The different use cases are described in following sub-sections and
   examples are provided how these uses cases can be modeled properly
   using the optical impairment aware TE-topology YANG data model.
  </t>
  
  <section anchor="Protection UC (i)">
    <name>OT and OTSi protection function are an integral part of the
    WDM-TE-node</name>
  
  <t>
   This use case is based on the architecture illustrated in
   <xref target="Figure-6"/> and the following entities are all
   integral parts of the WDM-TE-node:
   
    <ul spacing="compact">
      <li>Local optical transponder</li>
      <li>Splitter/selector protection function</li>
      <li>ROADM function</li>
    </ul>
    
   <xref target="Figure-11"/> illustrates such a WDM-TE-node
   configuration in transmit/forward direction where the protection
   function is an optical splitter and <xref target="Figure-12"/>
   illustrates the same WDM-TE-node configuration in receive/reverse
   direction where the protection function is an optical selector
   selecting one of the two incoming OTSi signals and switching to the
   other incoming OTSi signal when the optical power of the selected
   OTSi signal drops below a pre-defined threshold.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   The TE-topology YANG model has been augmented to describe this
   protection architecture. The already existing optional
   protection-type leaf of the TTP associated with the optical
   transceiver is used to indicate whether the TTP is protected, i.e.,
   whether it is connected to a protection function or whether it is
   unprotected, i.e., whether it is directly connected to an add-drop
   port of the ROADM function in the WDM-TE-node.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   For unprotected TTPs associated with an optical transceiver, the
   local-link-connectivity list describes the potential connectivity
   between the TTP and the LTPs of the WDM-TE-node that are the local
   end-points of the TE-links (OMS MCGs) interconnecting the
   WDM-TE-node with its neighbors, also often called degrees of the
   WDM-TE-node as opposed to its add-drop ports.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   For protected TTPs, the local-link-connectivity list has been
   augmented such that is is capable of describing the potential
   connectivity not only between the TTP and a single LTP a
   (unprotected case) but is now capable to describe the potential
   connectivity to additional LTPs including the related optical
   impairments. If the optical impairments are the same for all
   local-link-connectivity list entries for a particular TTP, which
   is usually the case, the optical impairments shall be omitted for
   the additional LTPs leading to a more compact topology description.
   If the optical impairments are different, however, they can be
   described for each additional LTP entry separately.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   A local-link-connectivity list example for a protected TTP in JSON
   format is provided in <xref target="JSON Examples"/>.

    <name>OT and OTSi protection/ROADM functions are in two adjacent
    WDM-TE-node (remote OT)</name>
  
  <t>
   This use case is based on the architecture illustrated in
   <xref target="Figure-7"/> where the optical transponder is not part
   of the WDM-TE-node containing the ROADM function (WDM-TE-Node-2) but
   is part of a separate WDM-TE-node (WDM-TE-Node-1) containing one or
   more optical transponders (remote OTs). WDM-TE-Node-2 contains:
   
    <ul spacing="compact">
      <li>Splitter/selector protection function</li>
      <li>ROADM function</li>
    </ul>
    
   <xref target="Figure-13"/> illustrates such a network configuration
   in transmit/forward direction showing the two WDM-TE-nodes where the
   protection function is the optical splitter in WDM-TE-Node-2 and
   <xref target="Figure-14"/> illustrates the same network
   configuration in receive/reverse direction where the protection
   function is the optical selector in WDM-TE-Node-2 selecting one of
   the two incoming OTSi signals and switching to the other incoming
   OTSi signal when the optical power of the selected OTSi signal drops
   below a pre-defined threshold.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   In the network configuration shown in <xref target="Figure-13"/> and
   <xref target="Figure-14"/>, respectively, the two WDM-TE-nodes are
   interconnected via a TE-link carrying a single OTSi signal.
   This TE-link interconnects the remote OT with an add-drop port of
   WDM-TE-Node-2 and in the following the qualifier "add-drop" is used
   to refer to that LTP as opposed to the line LTPs representing
   degrees of WDM-TE-Node-2.
   Similar to the protected TTP in <xref target="Protection UC (i)"/>,
   the optional protection-type leaf is used to indicate whether the
   add-drop LTP is connected to a protection function and then to two
   line LTPs via the ROADM function inside WDM-TE-Node-2 or whether it
   is connected to a single line LTP via the ROADM function inside
   WDM-TE-Node-2 (unprotected add-drop LTP). While the protection-type
   attribute was already defined for the TTP, the YANG model has been
   augmented to also support this optional attribute for the LTP.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   For protected LTPs, the connectivity-matrix has been augmented such
   that it is capable of describing the potential connectivity not only
   from an add-drop LTP to a single line LTP (unprotected case) but is
   now capable to describe the potential connectivity to additional
   line LTPs (protected case) including the related optical
   impairments. If the optical impairments are the same from the
   protected ad-drop LTP to all line LTPs, which is usually the case,
   the optical impairments shall be omitted for the additional LTPs
   leading to a more compact connectivity matrix description. If the
   optical impairments are different, however, they can be described
   for each additional LTP separately.

   The use case illustrated in <xref target="Figure-15"/> is similar to
   the use case in <xref target="Protection UC (i)"/>. The difference
   compared to use case (i) is  that WDM-TE-Node-1 does not contain the
   ROADM function but contains:
   
    <ul spacing="compact">
      <li>Optical transponder function including the transceiver</li>
      <li>Splitter/selector protection function</li>
    </ul>
   
   WDM-TE-Node-1 can be a data center device or a router router device
   that supporting 1+1 OTSi protection for its OTs while WDM-TE-Node-2
   is a WDM-TE-node providing add-drop ports for remote OTs as depicted
   in <xref target="Figure-7"/>. WDM-TE-Node-1 and WDM-TE-Node-2 are
   interconnected via two separate TE-links, each carrying a single
   OTSi signal. The protection configuration for the protected TTP in
   WDM-TE-Node-1 can be described in the same way as for use case (i)
   using the local-link-connectivity list.

  <t>
   OMS MCG protection is a 1+1 protection architecture where a TE-link
   representing an OMS MCG between two adjacent WDM-TE-nodes is 1+1
   protected. This media layer protection type is also described in
   Appendix III of <xref target="G.873.1 Amd1"/>.
   <xref target="OMS_MCG_prot"/> illustrates this 1+1 OMS MCG
   protection type and shows a 1+1 protected TE-link together with an
   unprotected TE-link between the same two adjacent WDM-TE-Nodes. The
   protected TE-link in <xref target="OMS_MCG_prot"/> is composed of an
   underlying primary and secondary TE-link. This  modeling approach is
   described below.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   1+1 OMS MCG protection is a local protection scheme, which can be
   modeled based on TE-link properties already defined in
   <xref target="RFC8795"/>. The 1+1 protected TE-link is associated
   with the two underlying TE-links representing the physical links,
   which are forming the 1+1 protection group together with the
   splitter and selector functions in the adjacent WDM-TE-Nodes as
   depicted in <xref target="OMS_MCG_prot"/>. This modeling approach
   is described in more detail in
   <xref target="Prot_TE-link_underlay"/>.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   Alternatively, it is possible to model the 1+1 OMS MCG protection
   as single protected TE-link abstracting the two underlying physical
   links as well as the splitter and selector functions in the two
   adjacent WDM-TE-Nodes. This modeling approach is described in more
   detail in <xref target="Prot_TE-link_abstraction"/>.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   For both modeling approaches, the splitter and selector functions
   are not represented as separate entities in the model. Their optical
   impairments can be taken into account in the optical impairments of
   the ROADM paths in the two adjacent WDM-TE-Nodes (connectivity
   matrix and LLCL, respectively) or in the optical impairments of the
   1+1 protected TE-link abstracting the two underlying physical OMS
   links.

   This modeling approach models the 1+1 protected TE-link as an

   TE-link between the two adjacent WDM-TE-Nodes terminating the
   1+1 OMS MCG protection group formed by these two TE-links and the

   The optical impairments for the underlying primary and secondary

   of the two underlying TE-links shall be used. This should be 
   sufficient as input for path computation (worst case optical
   feasibility consideration).

   This modeling approach abstracts the two physical OMS links carrying

   The optical impairments exposed for this 1+1 protected TE-link are

   <xref target="OMS_MCG_prot_link_2a_fwd"/> and

   approach where the splitter/selector in the adjacent WDM-TE-Nodes,
   WDM-TE-Node-1 and WDM-TE-Node-2, as well as the two physical OMS MCG
   links are abstracted into a single 1+1 protected TE-link. This is
   illustrated by the the dotted line surrounding these four physical
   entities in <xref target="OMS_MCG_prot_link_2a_fwd"/> and
   <xref target="OMS_MCG_prot_link_2a_rev"/>, respectively. Based on
   this modeling approach, the ROADM port connected to the
   splitter/selector function is modeled as LTP for the 1+1 protected
   TE-link (LTP2 in WDM-TE-Node-1 and LTP3 in WDM-TE-Node-2).
   In this example, the connectivity matrix describes the optical
   impairments between LPT1 and LTP2 in WDM-TE-Node-1. Likewise, the
   connectivity matrix describes the optical impairments between LPT3
   and LTP4 in WDM-TE-Node-2.

  <t>
   Alternatively, the optical impairments imposed by the splitter and
   selector in each of the two adjacent WDM-TE-Nodes can also be
   included in the optical impairments described by the connectivity
   matrix of the two nodes instead of taking them into account as
   optical impairments of the 1+1 protected TE-link.
   This is illustrated in <xref target="OMS_MCG_prot_link_2b_fwd"/> in
   forward direction and <xref target="OMS_MCG_prot_link_2b_rev"/> in
   reverse direction below.
   In this case, the two physical ports on both ends of the 1+1
   protected TE-link are abstracted into a single LTP, LTP2 and LTP3,
   in forward direction and LTP3' and LTP2' in reverse direction.

  <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="sect-5">
<!-- Old text commented out and replaced by the new text below.
  <t>
   The configuration, state, and action data defined in this document
   are designed to be accessed via a management protocol with a secure
   transport layer, such as NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241"/>.  The
   NETCONF access control model <xref target="RFC8341"/> provides the
   means to restrict access for particular NETCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF protocol operations
   and content.
  </t>

  <t>
   A number of configuration data nodes defined in this document are
   read-only; however, these data nodes may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments (TBD).
  </t>
-->

  <t>
   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols
   such as NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241"/> or RESTCONF
   <xref target="RFC8040"/>. The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure
   transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is
   Secure Shell (SSH) <xref target="RFC6242"/>. The lowest RESTCONF
   layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is
   TLS <xref target="RFC8446"/>.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM)
   <xref target="RFC8341"/> provides the means to restrict access for
   particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of
   all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol operations and content.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   The YANG module specified in this document imports the ietf-network
   and ietf-network-topology models defined in
   <xref target="RFC8345"/>. This YANG module augments te-topology
   defined in <xref target="RFC8795"/> and consequently inherits
   te-topology subtrees and data nodes and their potential
   sensitivities and vulnerabilities. Therefore, the security
   considerations from <xref target="RFC8345"/> also apply to the YANG
   module defined in this document.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   The data nodes in this YANG module are not writable nor creatable
   nor deletable (i.e., config true) the data nodes are readable only
   (i.e., config false, which is the default). Although the data nodes
   are not susceptible to write operations or attacks
   (e.g., edit-config), network information may be exposed using read
   access (e.g., get, get-config, or notification) operations. Thus,
   controlling read access to specific data nodes containing sensitive
   or vulnerable information is important. Below are the specific
   subtrees, data nodes and subsequent sensitivity/vulnerability:

  <t>
   As described in <xref target="sect-2.3" />, the external shelf can
   be modeled as WDM-TE-Node with termination capability only (not
   switching) and the add/drop link between a remote optical
   transceiver and a ROADM add/drop port can be modeled as a WDM
   TE-link with the same optical impairments as those defined for a
   WDM TE-link between WDM-TE-nodes (OMS MCG).
  </t>
  
  <t>
   If the two WDM-TE-Nodes are reported in different network topology
   instances, the plug-id attribute, defined in 
   <xref target="RFC8795"/>, can be used to discover the adjacency for
   add/drop TE-links.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   It is worth noting that there are no standard protocols for
   automatic discovery of the adjacency between an external transceiver
   and a ROADM add/drop port and therefore the information reported in
   the plug-id can be either statically configured or provided through
   vendor-specific discovery mechanisms.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   Each add/drop TE-link carries a single OTSi between the transceiver
   and ROADM add/drop port and one or more OTSis in the reverse
   direction (between the ROADM add/drop and the transceiver).
  </t>

  <t>
   Depending on control architecture (e.g., when the two WDM-TE-Nodes
   are reported in different network topology instances by different
   controllers), the controller reporting the WDM-TE-Node, abstracting
   the external OT shelf, may be not able to provide the information
   about the end-to-end MC configuration (i.e.,flexi-n and flexi-m)
   nor of all the received OTSis, within the end-to-end MC, besides the
   configured incoming OTSi, since the end-to-end MC configuration
   depends on how the ROADM network is configured and the remote OT
   shelf is not aware of that.
  </t>

  <t>
   In this case only the incoming-otsi and outgoing-otsi can be
   reported within anend-to-end MC with an unspecified frequency-slot
   (i.e., without reporting flexi-n and flexi-m configuration of the
   end-to-end MC).
  </t>
  
  <t>
   When an OTSiG has more than one OTSi, its OTSis are carried by
   different parallel add/drop TE-links. In order to represent the fact
   that these OTSis are co-routed, the add/drop TE-links are bundled
   together in a bundled add/drop TE-link. The finest granularity for
   the bundled add/drop TE-link is the set of all the add/drop TE-links
   terminating on the same OT.
  </t>

  <t>
   For example, in <xref target="Figure-Appendix-B"/>, it is possible
   to define two bundled add/drop TE-links, one for OT1 and one for OT2
   or just one add/drop TE-link both OTs.
  </t>

  <t>
   The model for a bundled add/drop TE-link and the relationship with
   its component TE-links is already defined in the bundled-links
   container of <xref target="RFC8795"/>.
  </t>

  <t>
   In the general case, the optical impairments and connectivity
   constraints are reported for each add/drop TE-link and therefore no
   optical impairments are reported in the bundled add/drop TE-link
   that is used just to model the co-routing aspects of the OTSis
   belonging to the same OTSiG.
  </t>

  <t>
   The per-transceiver Local Link Connectivity (LLC) is used in the
   WDM-TE-Node which abstracts the remote OT shelf (e.g., WDM-TE-Node-1
   in <xref target="Figure-Appendix-B"/>), to represent the association
   between each transceiver and each LTP terminating the add/drop
   TE-link which models the transceiver port.
  </t>

  <t>
   The connectivity matrix in the WDM-TE-Node which abstract the edge
   ROADM (e.g., WDM-TE-Node-2 in <xref target="Figure-Appendix-B"/>)
   references the LTPs terminating the add/drop TE-links which models
   the ROADM add/drop ports.

  <name>Examples How to Use the organizational-mode Attribute</name>
  
  <t>
   One option to describe the transceiver capabilities of an optical
   transponder (supported-mode list in the supported-modes container
   as defied in <xref target="I-D.ietf-ccamp-rfc9093-bis" />) is to
   describe the organizational-modes a transceiver supports as
   described in section <xref target="organizational-modes"/>.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   <xref target="I-D.ietf-ccamp-rfc9093-bis" />) defines the
   operational-mode of type identityref, which means that the identity
   the operational-mode attribute is referring to needs to be defined
   in a separate organization-specific or vendor-specific YANG module.
   An example of such an organization-specific YANG module as well as a
   vendor-specific YANG module is provided below.

   YANG module example containing the identity definition for a 400G
   operational-mode specified by the organization Vendor B with the
   same identity name "400G-operational-mode" as an operational mode

  <t>
   If there are transceivers in a network that are supporting any of
   the two 400G operational modes, the one specified by Forum A or the
   one specified by Vendor B or even both, the different name spaces
   allow to unambiguously identify the two modes that are defined in
   the YANG modules above with exactly the same identity name.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   The NETCONF server providing the optical impairment-aware topology
   will have to support both YANG modules above and will have to
   advertise both as capability in the NETCONF hello message indicating
   that these operational mode identities are used in the description
   of the optical impairment-aware topology model defined in this
   document.
