  <section title="Introduction" anchor="sect-1">
  <t>
   In order to provision an optical connection (an optical path)
   through a wavelength switched optical networks (WSONs) or spectrum
   switched optical networks (SSONs), a combination of path continuity,
   resource availability, and impairment constraints must be met to
   determine viable and optimal paths through the network. The
   determination of appropriate paths is known as Impairment-Aware
   Routing and Wavelength Assignment (IA-RWA) <xref target="RFC6566"/>
   for WSON, while it is known as IA-Routing and Spectrum Assigment
   (IA-RSA) for SSON.
  </t>

  <t>
   This document provides a YANG data model for the impairment-aware
   Traffic Engineering (TE) topology in WSONs and SSONs. The YANG model
   described in this document is a WSON/SSON technology-specific Yang
   model based on the information model developed in
   <xref target="RFC7446"/> and the two encoding documents
   <xref target="RFC7581"/> and <xref target="RFC7579"/> that developed
   protocol independent encodings based on <xref target="RFC7446"/>.
  </t>

  <t>
   The intent of this document is to provide a YANG data model, which
   can be utilized by a Multi-Domain Service Coordinator (MDSC) to
   collect states of WSON impairment data from the Transport PNCs to
   enable impairment-aware optical path computation according to the
   ACTN Architecture <xref target="RFC8453"/>. The communication
   between controllers is done via a NETCONF <xref target="RFC8341"/>
   or a RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040"/>. Similarly,this model can
   also be exported by the MDSC to a Customer Network Controller (CNC),
   which can run an offline planning process to map latter the services
   in the network.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   It is worth noting that optical data plane interoperability is a
   complex topic especially in a multi vendor environment and usually
   requires joint engineering, which is independent from control plane
   and management plane capabilities. The YANG data model defined in
   this draft is providing sufficient information to enable optical
   impairment aware path computation. <vspace blankLines="0"/>
   Optical data plane interoperability is outside the scope of this
   draft.
  </t>

  <t>
   This document augments the generic TE topology draft
   <xref target="RFC8795"/> where possible.
  </t>

  <t>
   This document defines one YANG module: ietf-optical-impairment-
   topology (<xref target="sect-3"/>) according to the new Network
   Management Datastore Architecture <xref target="RFC8342"/>.

  <section title="OMS Media Links" anchor="sect-2.3">
  <t>
   According to <xref target="G.872"/>, OMS Media Link represents a media
   link between two ROADMs. Specifically, it originates at the ROADM's
   Filter in the source ROADM and terminates at the ROADM's Filter in the
   destination ROADM.
  </t>

  <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
OTS Media Link represents a media link:

  (i)  between ROADM's BA and ILA;
 (ii)  between a pair of ILAs;
(iii)  between ILA and ROADM's PA.
]]></artwork>
  </figure>
  
  <t>
   OMS Media link can be decomposed in a sequence of OTS links type
   (i), (ii), and (iii) as discussed above. OMS Media link would give
   an abstracted view of impairment data (e.g., power, OSNR, etc.) to
   the network controller.
  </t>

  <t>
   For the sake of optical impairment evaluation OMS Media link can be
   also decomposed in a sequence of elements such as BA, fiber section,
   ILA, concentrated loss and PA.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   An OMS Media link is terminated on both ends by a link termination
   point (LTP) as defined in <xref target="RFC8345"/>.
   Links in optical transport networks are typically bidirectional but
   have to be modeled as a pair of two unidirectional links following
   the  <xref target="RFC8345"/> modeling approach.
   Unlike TE links, which are unidirectional, the LTPs on either end
   of the TE link pair forming the bidirectional link, are bidirectional
   as described in
   <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-te-topo-and-tunnel-modeling"/>.

  <section title="Optical Tributary Signal (OTSi)" anchor="sect-2.3.1">
  <t>
   The OTSi is defined in ITU-T Recommendation G.959.1, section 3.2.4
   <xref target="G.959.1"/>. The YANG model defined below assumes that a
   single OTSi    consists of a single modulated optical carrier. This
   single modulated optical carrier conveys digital information.
   Characteristics of the OTSi signal are modulation scheme (e.g. QPSK,
   8-QAM, 16-QAM, etc.), baud rate (measure of the symbol rate), pulse
   shaping (e.g. raised cosine - complying with the Nyquist inter
   symbol interference criterion), etc.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   Path computation needs to know the existing OTSi signals for each
   OMS link in the topology to determine the optical impairment impact
   of the existing OTSi signals on the optical feasibility of a new
   OTSi signal and vice versa, i.e., the impact of the new OTSi on the
   existing OTSi signals. For determining the optical feasibility of
   the new OTSi, it is necessary to know the OTSi properties like
   carrier frequency, baud rate, and signal power for all existing
   OTSi signals on each OMS link.
  </t> 
  
  <t>  
   Additionally, it is necessary for each ROADM node in the network to
   know the OTSi signals that are added to or dropped from an OMS
   link as well as the optical power of these OTSi signals to check
   whether the ROADM's optical power constraints are met.
  </t>

  <t>
   The optical impairment-aware topology YANG model below defines the
   OTSi properties needed for optical impairment-aware path computation
   including the spectrum occupied by each OTSi signal. The model also
   defines a pointer (leafref) from the OTSi to the transceiver module
   terminating the OTSi signal.   
  </t>  

  </section>

  <section title="Optical Tributary Signal Group (OTSiG)" anchor="sect-2.3.2">
  <t>
   The definition of the OTSiG is currently being moved from ITU-T
   Recommendation G.709 <xref target="G.709"/> to the new draft
   Recommendation G.807 (still work in progress) [G.807]. The OTSiG is an
   electrical signal that is carried by one or more OTSi's. The
   relationship between the OTSiG and the the OTSi's is described in ITU-T
   draft Recommendation G.807, section 10.2 [G.807]. The YANG model below
   supports both cases: the single OTSi case where the OTSiG contains a
   single OTSi (see ITU-T draft Recommendation G.807, Figure 10-2) and the
   multiple OTSi case where the OTSiG consists of more than one OTSi (see
   ITU-T draft Recommendation G.807, Figure 10-3). From a layer 0 topology
   YANG model perspective, the OTSiG is a logical construct that
   associates the OTSi's, which belong to the same OTSiG. The typical
   application of an OTSiG consisting of more than one OTSi is inverse
   multiplexing. Constraints exist for the OTSi's belonging to the same
   OTSiG such as: (i) all OTSi's must be co-routed over the same
   optical fibers and nodes and (ii) the differential delay between the
   different OTSi's may not exceed a certain limit. Example: a 400Gbps
   client signal may be carried by 4 OTSi's where each OTSi carries
   100Gbps of client traffic.

   (still work in progress) [G.807]. Section 3.2.2 defines the term MC
   and section 7.1.2 provides a more detailed description with some
   examples. The definition of the MC is very generic (see ITU-T draft
   Recommendation G.807, Figure 7-1). In the YANG model below, the MC
   is used with the following semantics:
  </t>

  <t>
   The MC is an end-to-end topological network construct and can be
   considered as an "optical pipe" with a well-defined frequency slot
   between one or more optical transmitters each generating an OTSi and
   the corresponding optical receivers terminating the OTSi's. If the
   MC carries more than one OTSi, it is assumed that these OTSi's
   belong to the same OTSiG.

   The frequency slot of the MC is defined by the n value defining the
   central frequency of the MC and the m value that defines the width
   of the MC following the flexible grid definition in ITU-T
   Recommendation G.694.1 <xref target="G.694.1"/>. In this model, the effective
   frequency slot as defined in ITU-T draft Recommendation G.807 is
   equal to the frequency slot of this end-to-end MC. It is also
   assumed that ROADM devices can switch MCs. For various reasons (e.g.
   differential delay), it is preferred to use a single MC for all
   OTSi's of the same OTSiG. It may however not always be possible to
   find a single MC for carrying all OTSi's of an OTSiG due to spectrum
   occupation along the OTSiG path.

   The definition of the MCG is currently work in progress in ITU-T and
   is defined in section 7.1.3 of the new ITU-T draft Recommendation
   G.807 (still work in progress) [G.807]. The YANG model below assumes

   The MCG can be considered as an association of MCs without defining
   a hierarchy where each MC is defined by its (n,m) value pair. An MCG
   consists of more than one MC when no single MC can be found from
   source to destination that is wide enough to accommodate all OTSi's

   the set of OTSi's belonging to a single OTSiG have to be split

  <section title="Amplifiers" anchor="sect-2.4">
  <t>
   Optical amplifiers are in charge of amplifying the optical signal in
   the optical itself without any electrical conversion. There are
   three main technologies to build amplifiers: Erbium Doped Fiber
   Amplifier (EDFA), Raman Fiber Amplifier (RFA), and Semiconductor
   Optical Amplifier (SOA). Nowadays, most of optical networks uses
   EDFAs. However, RFA has an attractive feature that it works in any
   wavelength band with a similar or lower noise figures compared to
   EDFA. On the other hand, RFAs consumes more power and are more
   expensive than EDFAs.
  </t>

  <t>
   Amplifiers can be classified according to their location in the
   communication link. There are three basic types of amplifiers: ILA,
   Pre-Amplifier and Booster. ILA is In-Line Amplifier which is a
   separate node type while Pre-Amplifier and Booster Amplifier are
   integral elements of ROADM node. From a data modeling perspective,
   Pre-Amplifier and Booster Amplifier are internal functions of a
   ROADM node and as such these elements are hidden within ROADM node.
   In this document, we would avoid internal node details, but attempt
   to abstract as much as possible.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   ILAs are placed at locations where the optical amplification of the
   WDM signal is required on the OMS link between two ROADM nodes.
   Geolocation information is already defined for TE nodes in
   <xref target="RFC8795"/> and is also beneficial for ILAs. Therefore,
   the same geolocation container has been added to the amplifier
   element on an OMS link containing altitude, latitude, and longitude
   as optional attributes.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   One modeling consideration of the ROADM internal is to model power
   parameter through the ROADM, factoring the output power from the
   Pre-Amplifier minus the ROADM power loss would give the input power
   to the Booster Amplifier. In other words, Power_in (@ ROADM Booster)
   = Power_out (@ ROADM Pre-Amplifier) - Power_loss (@ ROADM
   WSS/Filter).

  <section title="Transponders" anchor="sect-2.5">
  <t>
   [Editor's note: The relationship between the transponder and the
   OTSi in the YANG model described in <xref target="sect-3"></xref>
   needs further clarification and refinement.]
  </t>

  <t>
   A Transponder is the element that sends and receives the optical
   signal from a DWDM network. A transponder can comprise one or more
   transceiver modules. A transceiver represents a transmitter/receiver
   (Tx/Rx) pair as defined in ITU-T Recommendation G.698.2
   <xref target="G.698.2"/>. In addition to the transceiver, which is
   terminating an OTSi signal, a transponder typically provides
   additional layer 1 functionality like for example aggregation
   (multiplexing) of client layer signals, which is outside the scope
   of this document addressing layer 0 aspects of transponders.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   The termination of an OTSi signal by a transceiver is modeled as a
   tunnel termination point (TTP) as defined in
   <xref target="RFC8345"/>.
   Due to the fact that optical transport services (TE tunnels) are
   typically bidirectional, a TTP is also modeled as a bidirectional
   entity like the LTP described above. Moreover, a TTP can terminate
   one or several OTSi signals (tunnels) as described in
   <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-te-topo-and-tunnel-modeling"/> and my
   therefore be associated with multiple transceiver modules.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   A transponder is typically characterized by its data/symbol rate
   and the maximum distance the signal can travel. Other transponder
   properties are: carrier frequency for the optical channels,
   output power per channel, measured input power, modulation scheme,
   FEC, etc.
  </t>

  <t>
   From a path computation perspective, the selection of the compatible
   configuration of the source and the destination transceivers is an
   important factor for optical signals to traverse through the DWDM
   network.
  </t>
  
  <!--<t>
   A Transponder is the element that sends and receives the optical
   signal from a fiber. A transponder is typically characterized by its
   data rate and the maximum distance the signal can travel. Channel
   frequency, per channel input power, FEC and Modulation are also
   associated with a transponder. From a path computation point of
   view, the selection of the compatible source and destination
   transponders is an important factor for optical signal to traverse
   through the fiber. There are three main approaches to determine
   optical signal compatibility. Application Code based on G.698.2
   <xref target="G.698.2"/> is one approach that only checks the code
   at both ends of the link. Another approach is organization codes
   that are specific to an organization or a vendor. The third approach
   is specify all the relevant parameters explicitly, e.g., FEC type,
   Modulation type, etc.
  </t>-->
  
  <t>
   The YANG model defines three different approaches to describe the
   transceiver capabilities (called "modes") that are needed to
   determine optical signal compatibility:
  </t>
  
  <t>
    <list style="symbols"><?rfc subcompact="yes"?>
      <t>Standard Modes</t>
      <t>Organizational Modes</t>
      <t>Explicit Modes</t>
    <?rfc subcompact="no"?>
    </list></t>


  <section title="Standard Modes" anchor="sect-2.5.1">
  <t>
   A standard mode is related to an optical specification developed
   by an SDO organization. Currently, the "Standard Modes" can only
   be referred to ITU-T G.698.2 <xref target="G.698.2"/> since G.698.2
   is the only specification defining "Standard Modes" today.
   Nothing is precluding, however, to consider other specifications
   provided by any other SDO in the Standard Mode context as soon as
   such sepcifications will be available. An application code as
   defined in ITU-T G.698.2 <xref target="G.698.2"/> is representing
   a standard ITU-T G.698.2 optical interface specification towards
   the realization of transversely compatible DWDM systems.
   Two transceivers supporting the same application code and a line
   system matching the constraints, defined in ITU-T G.698.2, for that
   application code will interoperate. As the characteristics are
   encoded in the application code, the YANG model in this document
   only defines a string, which represents that application code.
  </t>
  
  </section>
  
  <section title="Organizational Modes" anchor="sect-2.5.2">
  <t>
   Organizations like operator groups, industry fora, or equipment
   vendors can define their own optical interface specifications and
   make use of transceiver capabilities going beyond existing standards. 
  </t>
  
  <t>
   An organizational mode is identified by the organization-identifier
   attribute defining the scope and an operational-mode that is meaningful
   within the scope of the organization. Hence, the two attributes must
   always be considered together. It is the responsibility of the
   organization to assign operational modes and to ensure that operational
   modes are unique and unambiguous within the scope of the organization.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   Two transceivers can be interconnected, if they have at least one
   (organization-identifier, operational-mode) pair in common and if the
   supported carrier frequency and power attributes have a matching range.
   This is a necessary condition for path computation in the context of
   organizational modes.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   An operational mode is a transceiver preset (a configuration with
   well-defined parameter values) subsuming several transceiver properties
   defined by the optical interface specification - these properties are
   not provided for anoperational mode and are therefore not defined in the
   YANG model. Examples of these properties are:
  </t>

  <t><list style="symbols"><?rfc subcompact="yes"?>
    <t>FEC type</t>
    <t>Modulation scheme</t>
    <t>Encoding (mapping of bit patterns (code words) to symbols in the
       constellation diagram)</t>
    <t>Baud rate (symbol rate)</t>
    <t>Carrier bandwidth (typically measured in GHz)</t>
    <?rfc subcompact="no"?>
  </list></t>
  
  <t>
   The major reason for these transceiver presets is the fact that the
   attribute values typically cannot be configured independently and
   are therefore advertised as supported operational mode capabilities.
   It is the responsibility of the organization to assign operational
   modes and to ensure that operational modes are unique and not
   ambiguous within the scope of the organization.
  </t>

  <t>
   In addition to the transceiver properties subsumed by the
   operational mode, optical power and carrier frequency related
   properties are modeled separately, i.e., outside of the operational
   mode. This modeling approach allows transponders using different
   transceiver variants (e.g. optical modules) with slightly different
   power and/or frequency range properties to interoperate without
   defining separate operational modes. Different optical modules
   (pluggables) from different suppliers typically have slightly
   different input and output power ranges or may have slightly
   different carrier frequency tuning ranges.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   The received channel power and the received total power are two
   parameters that can be measured by the receiver and can be provided
   by the transceiver in order to allow a controller to determine the
   expected performance of the end-to-end service taking into account
   the optical impairments along the path.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   An organization may define the operational modes to include the
   optical power and carrier frequency related properties following the
   application code approach as defined in ITU-T Recommendation G.698.2
   <xref target="G.698.2"/>. In such a case, the explicit optical power
   and carrier frequency related optional attributes shall be omitted
   in order to avoid redundant information in the description of the
   transceiver capabilities. If these attributes are provided in
   addition to the operational modes including these attribute values
   implicitly, the parameter values provided explicitly replace the
   implicit values and take precedence. This shall, however, only be
   an done in exceptional cases and shall be avoided whenever possible.
   In case an implicitly given range is extended utilizing the explicit
   optional attributes, a path computation policy rule may be applied
   to select a value preferably from the range defined implicitly and
   to only select a value from the extended range if no path can be
   found for values in the implicitly defined range. Path computation
   policy is outside the scope of this topology YANG model.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   In summary, the optical power and carrier frequency related
   attributes shall either be described implicitly by the operational
   mode following the definition provided by that organization or shall
   be described explicitly when the optical power and carrier frequency
   related properties are not included in the operational mode
   definition.
  </t>
  </section>

  <section title="Explicit Modes" anchor="sect-2.5.3">
  <t>
   The explicit mode allows to encode, explicitly, any subset of
   parameters e.g., FEC type, Modulation type, etc, to enable a
   controller entity to check for interoperability by means outside
   of this draft. It shall be noted that using the explicit encoding
   does not guarantee interoperability between two transceivers even
   in case of identical parameter definitions. The explicit mode
   shall therefore be used with care, but it could be useful when no
   common Application Codes or Organizational Modes exist or the
   constraints of common Application Codes or Organizational Modes
   cannot be met by the line system.
  </t>
  
  </section>

  <section title="Transponder Capabilities and Current Configuration" anchor="sect-2.5.4">
  <t>
   The YANG model described in <xref target="sect-3"/> defines the
   optical transceiver properties. They are divided between:
  </t>

   <t>Current transceiver setting, indicating how it is currently configured</t>
  <?rfc subcompact="no"?>
  </list></t>
  
  <t>
   The transceiver capabilities are described by the set of modes the
   transceiver is supporting. Each mode MUST follow only one of the
   three mode options defined above (choice in the YANG model). The
   YANG model allows to describe the transceiver capabilities by mixing
   different modes. A transceiver may support some ITU-T application
   codes and in addition some organizational or explicit modes.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   A transceiver mode description comprises the following properties:

  <t><list style="symbols"><?rfc subcompact="yes"?>
   <t>Supported transmitter tuning range with min/max nominal carrier
      frequency [f_tx_min, f_tx_max]</t>

   <t>Supported transmitter power range [p_tx-min, p_tx_max]</t>

   <t>Supported maximum total power, rx power for all channels fed
      into the receiver</t>
  <?rfc subcompact="no"?>
  </list></t>
  
  <t>
   These optical transceiver properties are explicitly defined in the
   model for explicit and organizational modes, while they are
   implicitly defined for the application codes (see ITU-T G698.2
   <xref target="G.698.2"/>).
  </t>
  
  <t>
   The set of optical impairment limits, e.g., min OSNR, max PMD,
   max CD, max PDL, Q-factor limit, are explicitly defined for the
   explicit modes while they are  defined implicitly for the
   application codes and organizational modes.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   It is possible that the set of parameter values defined for an
   explicit mode may also be represented in form of an organizational
   mode or one or more application codes. The “supported-mode”
   container may provide two different lists with pointers to
   application codes and organizational modes, respectively.

   The current transponder configuration describes the properties of
   the OTSi transmitted or received by the transceiver attached to a

  <section title="3R Regenerators" anchor="sect-2.6">
  
  <t>
   Optical transponders are usually used to terminate a layer 0 tunnel (layer 0
   service) in the WDM layer. If, however, no optical path can be found from
   the source transponder to the destination transponder that is optically
   feasible due to the optical impairments, one or more 3R regenerators are
   needed for regenerating the optical signal in intermediate nodes.
   The term "3R" regenerator means: reamplification, reshaping, retiming.
   As described in <xref target="G.807"/>, Appendix IV, a 3R regenerator
   terminates the OTSi and generates a new OTSi. Depending on the 3R
   regenerator capabilities, it can provide functions such as carrier frequency
   translation (carrier-frequency), changes in the modulation scheme
   (modulation-type) and FEC (FEC-type) while passing through the digital
   signal except the FEC (the FEC is processed and errors are corrected).
  </t>

  <t>
   The 3R regeneartion compound function is illustrated in section 10.1 of
   <xref target="G.798.1"/>, and sections 10.3 and 10.4 provide examples of a
   ROADM architecture and a photonic cross-connect architecture including 3R
   regenerators.
   Based on the provided functionality, 3R regenerators are considered as
   topological layer 0 entities because they are needed for layer 0 path
   computation in case the optical impairments make it impossible to find an
   optically feasible end-to-end path from the source transponder to the
   destination transponder without 3R regeneration.
   When an end-to-end path includes one or more 3R regenerators, the
   corresponding layer 0 tunnel is subdivided into 2 or more segments between
   the source transponder and the destination transponder terminating the
   layer 0 tunnel.
  </t>
  
  <t>
   3R regenerators are usually realized by a pair of optical transponders,
   which are described in <xref target="sect-2.5"/> above. If a pair of optical
   transponders is used to perform a 3R regeneratator function, two different
   configurations are possible involving the pair of optical transceivers of
   the two optical transponders:
  </t>

  <t><list style="symbols">
   <t>
    The two transponders can be operated in a back-to-back configuration where
    the transceiver of each optical transponder receives and transmits the
    optical signal from/to the same segment of the end-to-end tunnel. This means
    that each transceiver is operated in a bi-directional mode.

   Due to the fact that 3R regenerators are composed of an optical transponder
   pair, the capabilitiy whether an optical transponder can be used as a 3R
   regenerator is is added to the transponder capabilities. Hence, no
   additional entity is required for describing 3R regenerators in the
   TE-topology YANG model. The optical transonder capabilities regarding the 3R
   regenerator function are described by the following two YANG model attributes:
  </t>

  <t><list style="symbols"><?rfc subcompact="yes"?>
  <t>supported-termination-type</t>
  <t>supported-3r-mode</t>
  <?rfc subcompact="no"?>
  </list></t>

  <t>
   The supported-termination-type attribute describes whether the optical
   transponder can be used as tunnel terminating transponder only, as 3R
   regenerator only, or whether it can support both functions.
   The supported-3r-mode attrbute describes the configuration of the
   transponder pair forming the 3R regeneartor as described above.

   WSS separates the incoming light input spectrally as well as
   spatially, then chooses the wavelength that is of interest by
   deflecting it from the original optical path and then couple it to
   another optical fibre port. WSS/Filter is internal to ROADM. So this

   The TE topology YANG model augmentations including optical

   3 categories of ROADM architectures listed above. In the case of a
   disaggregated ROADM architecture, it is assumed that optical domain
   controller already performs some form of abstraction and presents
   the TE-node representing the disaggregated ROADM in the same way as
   an integrated ROADM with integrated optical transponders if the
   optical transponder subsystems and the add/drop subsystems are
   collocated (short fiber links not imposing significant optical
   impairments).
  </t>

  <t>
   The different ROADM architectures are briefly described and
   illustrated in the following subsections.

   [Editor's note: The modeling of remote optical transponders located
   for example in the client device with a single channel link between
   the OT and the add/drop port of the ROADM requires further

  <t>
   <xref target="Figure-2"/> and <xref target="Figure-6"/> below show the
   typical architecture of an integrated ROADM node, which contains the
   optical transponders as an integral part of the ROADM node. Such an
   integrated ROADM node provides DWDM interfaces as external interfaces
   for interconnecting the device with its neighboring ROADMs (see OTS link
   above). The number of these interfaces denote also the degree of the
   ROADM. A degree 3 ROADM for example has 3 DWDM links that interconnect
   the ROADM node with 3 neighboring ROADMs. Additionally, the ROADM
   provides client interfaces for interconnecting the ROADM with client
   devices such as IP routers or Ethernet switches. These client interfaces
   are the client interfaces of the integrated optical transponders.

   <xref target="Figure-7"/> below shows the extreme case where all optical
   transponders are not integral parts of the ROADM but are separate
   devices that are interconnected with add/drop ports of the ROADM. If
   the optical transponders and the ROADM are collocated and if short
   single channel fiber links are used to interconnect the optical

  <section title="Disaggregated ROADMs Subdivided into Degree, Add/Drop, and Optical Transponder Subsystems"
   anchor="sect-2.9.3">
  <t>
   Recently, some DWDM network operators started demanding ROADM
   subsystems from their vendors. An example is the OpenROADM project
   where multiple operators and vendors are developing related YANG
   models. The subsystems of a disaggregated ROADM are: single degree
   subsystems, add/drop subsystems and optical transponder subsystems.
   These subsystems separate network elements and each network element
   provides a separate management and control interface. The subsystems
   are typically interconnected using short fiber patch cables and form
   together a disaggregated ROADM node. This disaggregated ROADM
   architecture is depicted in <xref target="Figure-8"/> below.
  </t>

  <t>
   As this document defines TE topology YANG model augmentations
   <xref target="RFC8795"/> for the TE topology YANG
   model provided at the north-bound interface of the optical domain
   controller, it is a valid assumption that the optical domain controller
   abstracts the subsystems of a disaggregated ROADM and presents the
   disaggregated ROADM in the same way as an integrated ROADM hiding all
   the interconnects that are not relevant from an external TE topology
   view.

  <section title="Optical Impairments Imposed by ROADM Nodes" anchor="sect-2.9.4">
  
  <t>
   When an optical OTSi signal traverses a ROADM node, optical impairments
   are imposed on the signal by various passive or active optical components
   inside the ROADM node. Examples of optical impairments are:
  </t>
  
  <t><list style="symbols"><?rfc subcompact="yes"?>
   <t>Chromatic dispersion (CD)</t>
   <t>Polarization mode dispersion (PMD)</t>
   <t>Polarization dependent loss (PDL)</t>
   <t>Optical amplifier noise due to amplified spontaneous emission (ASE)</t>
   <t>In-band cross-talk</t>
   <t>Filtering effects (for further study)</t>
  <?rfc subcompact="no"?>
  </list></t>
  
  <t>
   A ROADM node contains a wavelength selective photonic switching function
   (WSS)that is capable of switching media channels (MCs) described in
   <xref target="sect-2.3.4"/>. These MCs can be established between two
   line ports of the ROADM or between a line port and an Add/Drop port of
   the ROADM. The Add/Drop ports of a ROADM are those ports to which optical
   transponders are connected. Typically, this is a single channel signal
   (single OTSi), but principally this could also be a group of OTSi
   signals. The optical impairments associated with these MCs are different
   and the paths of the MCs inside the ROADM node can be categorized as
   follows:
  </t>
  
  <t><list style="symbols"><!-- <?rfc subcompact="yes"?> -->
  <t>Express path: MC path between two line ports of the ROADM
    (unidirectional)</t>
  <t>Add Path: MC path from an Add port to a line port of the ROADM</t>
  <t>Drop path: MC path from a line port to a Drop port of the ROADM</t>
  <!-- <?rfc subcompact="no"?> -->
  </list></t>
  
  <t>
   Due to the symmetrical architecture of the ROADM node, the optical
   impairments associated with the express path are typically the same
   between any two line ports of the ROADM whereas the optical impairments
   for the add and drop paths are different and therefore have to be
   modeled separately.
  </t>
 
  <t>
   The optical impairments associated with each of the three types of
   ROADM-node-internal paths described above are modeled as optical
   impairment parameter sets. These parameter sets are modeled as an
   augmentation of the te-node-attributes defined in
   <xref target ="RFC8795"/>.
   The te-node-attributes are augmented with a list of roadm-path-impairments
   for the three ROADM path types distinguished by the impairment-type. Each
   roadm-path-impairments list entry contains the set of optical impairment
   parameters for one of the three path types indicated by the impairment-type.
   For the optical feasibility calculation based on the optical impairments,
   it is necessary to know whether the optical power of the OTSi stays within
   a certain power window. This is reflected by some optical power related
   parameters such as loss parameters or power parameters, which are included
   in the optical impairment parameter sets (see tree view in
   <xref target="sect-3"/>).
  </t>
  
  <t>
   <xref target ="RFC8795"/> defines a connectivity
   matrix and a local link connectivity list for the TE node. The
   connectivity matrix describes the connectivity for the express paths
   between the different lines of the ROADM and the local link connectivity
   list describes the connectivity for the Add and Drop paths of the ROADM.
   These matrices are augmented with a new roadm-path-impairment matrix
   element, an add-path-impairment, and drop-path-impairment matrix element,
   respectively, which are defined as a pointer to the corresponding entry
   in the roadm-path-impairments list (leaf-ref).

   The configuration, state, and action data defined in this document
   are designed to be accessed via a management protocol with a secure
   transport layer, such as NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241"/>.  The
   NETCONF access control model <xref target="RFC8341"/> provides the
   means to restrict access for particular NETCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF protocol operations
   and content.

   A number of configuration data nodes defined in this document are
   read-only; however, these data nodes may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments (TBD).
