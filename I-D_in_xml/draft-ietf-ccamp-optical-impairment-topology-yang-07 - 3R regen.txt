        A YANG Data Model for Optical Impairment-aware Topology
          draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang-07

Abstract

   In order to provision an optical connection through optical networks,
   a combination of path continuity, resource availability, and
   impairment constraints must be met to determine viable and optimal
   paths through the network.  The determination of appropriate paths is
   known as Impairment-Aware Routing and Wavelength Assignment (IA-RWA)
   for WSON, while it is known as Impairment-Aware Routing and Spectrum
   Assigment (IA-RSA) for SSON.

   This document provides a YANG data model for the impairment-aware TE
   topology in optical networks.

1.  Introduction

   In order to provision an optical connection (an optical path) through
   a wavelength switched optical networks (WSONs) or spectrum switched
   optical networks (SSONs), a combination of path continuity, resource
   availability, and impairment constraints must be met to determine
   viable and optimal paths through the network.  The determination of
   appropriate paths is known as Impairment-Aware Routing and Wavelength
   Assignment (IA-RWA) [RFC6566] for WSON, while it is known as IA-
   Routing and Spectrum Assigment (IA-RSA) for SSON.

   This document provides a YANG data model for the impairment-aware
   Traffic Engineering (TE) topology in WSONs and SSONs.  The YANG model
   described in this document is a WSON/SSON technology-specific Yang
   model based on the information model developed in [RFC7446] and the
   two encoding documents [RFC7581] and [RFC7579] that developed
   protocol independent encodings based on [RFC7446].

   The intent of this document is to provide a YANG data model, which
   can be utilized by a Multi-Domain Service Coordinator (MDSC) to
   collect states of WSON impairment data from the Transport PNCs to
   enable impairment-aware optical path computation according to the
   ACTN Architecture [RFC8453].  The communication between controllers
   is done via a NETCONF [RFC8341] or a RESTCONF [RFC8040].
   Similarly,this model can also be exported by the MDSC to a Customer
   Network Controller (CNC), which can run an offline planning process
   to map latter the services in the network.

   It is worth noting that optical data plane interoperability is a
   complex topic especially in a multi vendor environment and usually
   requires joint engineering, which is independent from control plane
   and management plane capabilities.  The YANG data model defined in
   this draft is providing sufficient information to enable optical
   impairment aware path computation.
   Optical data plane interoperability is outside the scope of this
   draft.

   BA (on the left side ROADM) is the ingress Amplifier and PA (on the
   right side ROADM is the egress amplifier for the OMS link shown in
   Figure 2.

2.3.  OMS Media Links

   According to [G.872], OMS Media Link represents a media link between
   two ROADMs.  Specifically, it originates at the ROADM's Filter in the
   source ROADM and terminates at the ROADM's Filter in the destination
   ROADM.

   OTS Media Link represents a media link:

     (i)  between ROADM's BA and ILA;
    (ii)  between a pair of ILAs;
   (iii)  between ILA and ROADM's PA.

   OMS Media link can be decomposed in a sequence of OTS links type (i),
   (ii), and (iii) as discussed above.  OMS Media link would give an
   abstracted view of impairment data (e.g., power, OSNR, etc.) to the
   network controller.

   For the sake of optical impairment evaluation OMS Media link can be
   also decomposed in a sequence of elements such as BA, fiber section,
   ILA, concentrated loss and PA.

   [Editor's note: text below related to [G.807] needs to be revised!
   [G.807] is now in publication process.]

2.3.1.  Optical Tributary Signal (OTSi)

   The OTSi is defined in ITU-T Recommendation G.959.1, section 3.2.4
   [G.959.1].  The YANG model defined below assumes that a single OTSi
   consists of a single modulated optical carrier.  This single
   modulated optical carrier conveys digital information.
   Characteristics of the OTSi signal are modulation scheme (e.g.  QPSK,
   8-QAM, 16-QAM, etc.), baud rate (measure of the symbol rate), pulse
   shaping (e.g. raised cosine - complying with the Nyquist inter symbol
   interference criterion), etc.

2.3.2.  Optical Tributary Signal Group (OTSiG)

   The definition of the OTSiG is currently being moved from ITU-T
   Recommendation G.709 [G.709] to the new draft Recommendation G.807
   (still work in progress) [G.807].  The OTSiG is an electrical signal
   that is carried by one or more OTSi's.  The relationship between the
   OTSiG and the the OTSi's is described in ITU-T draft Recommendation
   G.807, section 10.2 [G.807].  The YANG model below supports both
   cases: the single OTSi case where the OTSiG contains a single OTSi
   (see ITU-T draft Recommendation G.807, Figure 10-2) and the multiple
   OTSi case where the OTSiG consists of more than one OTSi (see ITU-T
   draft Recommendation G.807, Figure 10-3).  From a layer 0 topology
   YANG model perspective, the OTSiG is a logical construct that
   associates the OTSi's, which belong to the same OTSiG.  The typical
   application of an OTSiG consisting of more than one OTSi is inverse
   multiplexing.  Constraints exist for the OTSi's belonging to the same
   OTSiG such as: (i) all OTSi's must be co-routed over the same optical
   fibers and nodes and (ii) the differential delay between the
   different OTSi's may not exceed a certain limit.  Example: a 400Gbps
   client signal may be carried by 4 OTSi's where each OTSi carries
   100Gbps of client traffic.

2.3.3.  Media Channel (MC)

   The definition of the MC is currently being moved from ITU-T
   Recommendation G.872 [G.872] to the new draft Recommendation G.807
   (still work in progress) [G.807].  Section 3.2.2 defines the term MC
   and section 7.1.2 provides a more detailed description with some
   examples.  The definition of the MC is very generic (see ITU-T draft
   Recommendation G.807, Figure 7-1).  In the YANG model below, the MC
   is used with the following semantics:

   The MC is an end-to-end topological network construct and can be
   considered as an "optical pipe" with a well-defined frequency slot
   between one or more optical transmitters each generating an OTSi and
   the corresponding optical receivers terminating the OTSi's.  If the
   MC carries more than one OTSi, it is assumed that these OTSi's belong
   to the same OTSiG.

   The frequency slot of the MC is defined by the n value defining the
   central frequency of the MC and the m value that defines the width of
   the MC following the flexible grid definition in ITU-T Recommendation
   G.694.1 [G.694.1].  In this model, the effective frequency slot as
   defined in ITU-T draft Recommendation G.807 is equal to the frequency
   slot of this end-to-end MC.  It is also assumed that ROADM devices
   can switch MCs.  For various reasons (e.g.  differential delay), it
   is preferred to use a single MC for all OTSi's of the same OTSiG.  It
   may however not always be possible to find a single MC for carrying
   all OTSi's of an OTSiG due to spectrum occupation along the OTSiG
   path.

2.3.4.  Media Channel Group (MCG)

   The definition of the MCG is currently work in progress in ITU-T and
   is defined in section 7.1.3 of the new ITU-T draft Recommendation
   G.807 (still work in progress) [G.807].  The YANG model below assumes
   that the MCG is a logical grouping of one or more MCs that are used
   to to carry all OTSi's belonging to the same OTSiG.

   The MCG can be considered as an association of MCs without defining a
   hierarchy where each MC is defined by its (n,m) value pair.  An MCG
   consists of more than one MC when no single MC can be found from
   source to destination that is wide enough to accommodate all OTSi's
   (modulated carriers) that belong to the same OTSiG.  In such a case
   the set of OTSi's belonging to a single OTSiG have to be split across
   2 or more MCs.

   The MCG is relevant for path computation because all end-to-end MCs
   belonging to the same MCG have to be co-routed, i.e., have to follow
   the same path.  Additional constraints may exist (e.g. differential
   delay).

2.4.  Amplifiers

   Optical amplifiers are in charge of amplifying the optical signal in
   the optical itself without any electrical conversion.  There are
   three main technologies to build amplifiers: Erbium Doped Fiber
   Amplifier (EDFA), Raman Fiber Amplifier (RFA), and Semiconductor
   Optical Amplifier (SOA).  Nowadays, most of optical networks uses
   EDFAs.  However, RFA has an attractive feature that it works in any
   wavelength band with a similar or lower noise figures compared to
   EDFA.  On the other hand, RFAs consumes more power and are more
   expensive than EDFAs.

   Amplifiers can be classified according to their location in the
   communication link.  There are three basic types of amplifiers: ILA,
   Pre-Amplifier and Booster.  ILA is In-Line Amplifier which is a
   separate node type while Pre-Amplifier and Booster Amplifier are
   integral elements of ROADM node.  From a data modeling perspective,
   Pre-Amplifier and Booster Amplifier are internal functions of a ROADM
   node and as such these elements are hidden within ROADM node.  In
   this document, we would avoid internal node details, but attempt to
   abstract as much as possible.

Internet-Draft    Opt. Impairment-Aware Topo YANG Model        July 2021


   One modeling consideration of the ROADM internal is to model power
   parameter through the ROADM, factoring the output power from the Pre-
   Amplifier minus the ROADM power loss would give the input power to
   the Booster Amplifier.  In other words, Power_in (@ ROADM Booster) =
   Power_out (@ ROADM Pre-Amplifier) - Power_loss (@ ROADM WSS/Filter).

2.5.  Transponders

   [Editor's note: The relationship between the transponder and the OTSi
   in the YANG model described in Section 3 needs further clarification
   and refinement.]

   A Transponder is the element that sends and receives the optical
   signal from a DWDM network.  A transponder can comprise one or more
   transceivers.  A transceiver can be seen as a pair of transmitter and
   receiver, as defined in ITU-T Recommendation G.698.2 [G.698.2].

   A transponder is typically characterized by its data/symbol rate and
   the maximum distance the signal can travel.  Other transponder
   properties are: carrier frequency for the optical channels, output
   power per channel, measured input power, modulation scheme, FEC, etc.

   From a path computation perspective, the selection of the compatible
   configuration of the source and the destination transceivers is an
   important factor for optical signals to traverse through the DWDM
   network.

   The YANG model defines three different approaches to describe the
   transceiver capabilities (called "modes") that are needed to
   determine optical signal compatibility:

   o  Standard Modes
   o  Organizational Modes
   o  Explicit Modes

2.5.1.  Standard Modes

   A standard mode is related to an optical specification developed by
   an SDO organization.  Currently, the "Standard Modes" can only be
   referred to ITU-T G.698.2 [G.698.2] since G.698.2 is the only
   specification defining "Standard Modes" today.  Nothing is
   precluding, however, to consider other specifications provided by any
   other SDO in the Standard Mode context as soon as such sepcifications
   will be available.  An application code as defined in ITU-T G.698.2
   [G.698.2] is representing a standard ITU-T G.698.2 optical interface
   specification towards the realization of transversely compatible DWDM
   systems.  Two transceivers supporting the same application code and a
   line system matching the constraints, defined in ITU-T G.698.2, for

Internet-Draft    Opt. Impairment-Aware Topo YANG Model        July 2021


   that application code will interoperate.  As the characteristics are
   encoded in the application code, the YANG model in this document only
   defines a string, which represents that application code.

2.5.2.  Organizational Modes

   Organizations like operator groups, industry fora, or equipment
   vendors can define their own optical interface specifications and
   make use of transceiver capabilities going beyond existing standards.

   An organizational mode is identified by the organization-identifier
   attribute defining the scope and an operational-mode that is
   meaningful within the scope of the organization.  Hence, the two
   attributes must always be considered together.  It is the
   responsibility of the organization to assign operational modes and to
   ensure that operational modes are unique and unambiguous within the
   scope of the organization.

   Two transceivers can be interconnected, if they have at least one
   (organization-identifier, operational-mode) pair in common and if the
   supported carrier frequency and power attributes have a matching
   range.  This is a necessary condition for path computation in the
   context of organizational modes.

   An operational mode is a transceiver preset (a configuration with
   well-defined parameter values) subsuming several transceiver
   properties defined by the optical interface specification - these
   properties are not provided for anoperational mode and are therefore
   not defined in the YANG model.  Examples of these properties are:

   o  FEC type
   o  Modulation scheme
   o  Encoding (mapping of bit patterns (code words) to symbols in the
      constellation diagram)
   o  Baud rate (symbol rate)
   o  Carrier bandwidth (typically measured in GHz)

   The major reason for these transceiver presets is the fact that the
   attribute values typically cannot be configured independently and are
   therefore advertised as supported operational mode capabilities.  It
   is the responsibility of the organization to assign operational modes
   and to ensure that operational modes are unique and not ambiguous
   within the scope of the organization.

   In addition to the transceiver properties subsumed by the operational
   mode, optical power and carrier frequency related properties are
   modeled separately, i.e., outside of the operational mode.  This
   modeling approach allows transponders using different transceiver



Lee, et al.             Expires January 13, 2022               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft    Opt. Impairment-Aware Topo YANG Model        July 2021


   variants (e.g. optical modules) with slightly different power and/or
   frequency range properties to interoperate without defining separate
   operational modes.  Different optical modules (pluggables) from
   different suppliers typically have slightly different input and
   output power ranges or may have slightly different carrier frequency
   tuning ranges.

   The received channel power and the received total power are two
   parameters that can be measured by the receiver and can be provided
   by the transceiver in order to allow a controller to determine the
   expected performance of the end-to-end service taking into account
   the optical impairments along the path.

   An organization may define the operational modes to include the
   optical power and carrier frequency related properties following the
   application code approach as defined in ITU-T Recommendation G.698.2
   [G.698.2].  In such a case, the explicit optical power and carrier
   frequency related optional attributes shall be omitted in order to
   avoid redundant information in the description of the transceiver
   capabilities.  If these attributes are provided in addition to the
   operational modes including these attribute values implicitly, the
   parameter values provided explicitly replace the implicit values and
   take precedence.  This shall, however, only be an done in exceptional
   cases and shall be avoided whenever possible.  In case an implicitly
   given range is extended utilizing the explicit optional attributes, a
   path computation policy rule may be applied to select a value
   preferably from the range defined implicitly and to only select a
   value from the extended range if no path can be found for values in
   the implicitly defined range.  Path computation policy is outside the
   scope of this topology YANG model.

   In summary, the optical power and carrier frequency related
   attributes shall either be described implicitly by the operational
   mode following the definition provided by that organization or shall
   be described explicitly when the optical power and carrier frequency
   related properties are not included in the operational mode
   definition.

2.5.3.  Explicit Modes

   The explicit mode allows to encode, explicitly, any subset of
   parameters e.g., FEC type, Modulation type, etc, to enable a
   controller entity to check for interoperability by means outside of
   this draft.  It shall be noted that using the explicit encoding does
   not guarantee interoperability between two transceivers even in case
   of identical parameter definitions.  The explicit mode shall
   therefore be used with care, but it could be useful when no common
   Application Codes or Organizational Modes exist or the constraints of

Internet-Draft    Opt. Impairment-Aware Topo YANG Model        July 2021


   common Application Codes or Organizational Modes cannot be met by the
   line system.

2.5.4.  Transponder Capabilities and Current Configuration

   The YANG model described in Section 3 defines the optical transceiver
   properties.  They are divided between:

   a.  Optical transceiver capabilities, describing how it can be
       configured
   b.  Current transceiver setting, indicating how it is currently
       configured

   The transceiver capabilities are described by the set of modes the
   transceiver is supporting.  Each mode MUST follow only one of the
   three mode options defined above (choice in the YANG model).  The
   YANG model allows to describe the transceiver capabilities by mixing
   different modes.  A transceiver may support some ITU-T application
   codes and in addition some organizational or explicit modes.

   A transceiver mode description comprises the following properties:

   o  Supported transmitter tuning range with min/max nominal carrier
      frequency [f_tx_min, f_tx_max]
   o  Supported transmitter tunability grid, the distance between two
      adjacent carrier frequencies (in GHz)
   o  Supported transmitter power range [p_tx-min, p_tx_max]
   o  Supported receiver channel power range [p_rx-min, p_rx_max]
   o  Supported maximum total power, rx power for all channels fed into
      the receiver

   These optical transceiver properties are explicitly defined in the
   model for explicit and organizational modes, while they are
   implicitly defined for the application codes (see ITU-T G698.2
   [G.698.2]).

   The set of optical impairment limits, e.g., min OSNR, max PMD, max
   CD, max PDL, Q-factor limit, are explicitly defined for the explicit
   modes while they are defined implicitly for the application codes and
   organizational modes.

   It is possible that the set of parameter values defined for an
   explicit mode may also be represented in form of an organizational
   mode or one or more application codes.  The "supported-mode"
   container may provide two different lists with pointers to
   application codes and organizational modes, respectively.

   The current transponder configuration describes the properties of the
   OTSi transmitted or received by the transceiver attached to a
   specific transponder port.

   Each OTSi has the following three pointer attributes modeled as
   leafrefs:

   o  Pointer to the transponder instance containing the transceiver
      terminating the OTSi
   o  Pointer to the transceiver instance terminating the OTSi
   o  Pointer to the currently configured transceiver mode

   Additionally, the OTSi is described by the following frequency and
   optical power related attributes:

   o  current carrier-frequency
   o  currently transmitted channel power
   o  currently received channel power
   o  currently received total power

2.6.  3R Regenerators

   Optical transponders are usually used to terminate a layer 0 tunnel
   (layer 0 service) in the WDM layer.  If, however, no optical path can
   be found from the source transponder to the destination transponder
   that is optically feasible due to the optical impairments, one or
   more 3R regenerators are needed for regenerating the optical signal
   in intermediate nodes.  The term "3R" regenerator means:
   reamplification, reshaping, retiming.  As described in [G.807],
   Appendix IV, a 3R regenerator terminates the OTSi and generates a new
   OTSi.  Depending on the 3R regenerator capabilities, it can provide
   functions such as carrier frequency translation (carrier-frequency),
   changes in the modulation scheme (modulation-type) and FEC (FEC-type)
   while passing through the digital signal except the FEC (the FEC is
   processed and errors are corrected).

   The 3R regeneartion compound function is illustrated in section 10.1
   of [G.798.1], and sections 10.3 and 10.4 provide examples of a ROADM
   architecture and a photonic cross-connect architecture including 3R
   regenerators.  Based on the provided functionality, 3R regenerators
   are considered as topological layer 0 entities because they are
   needed for layer 0 path computation in case the optical impairments
   make it impossible to find an optically feasible end-to-end path from
   the source transponder to the destination transponder without 3R
   regeneration.  When an end-to-end path includes one or more 3R
   regenerators, the corresponding layer 0 tunnel is subdivided into 2
   or more segments between the source transponder and the destination
   transponder terminating the layer 0 tunnel.

   3R regenerators are usually realized by a pair of optical
   transponders, which are described in Section 2.5 above.  If a pair of
   optical transponders is used to perform a 3R regeneratator function,
   two different configurations are possible involving the pair of
   optical transceivers of the two optical transponders:

   o  The two transponders can be operated in a back-to-back
      configuration where the transceiver of each optical transponder
      receives and transmits the optical signal from/to the same segment
      of the end-to-end tunnel.  This means that each transceiver is
      operated in a bi-directional mode.

   o  The two transponders can be operated in a configuration where each
      transponder performs the 3R regeneration function in one
      direction, one in forward direction (from source to destination)
      and the other in the reverse direction.  In this configuration,
      the transceiver of each optical transponder receives the signal
      from one segment and transmits the regenerated optical signal into
      the adjacent segment.  This configuration is also called cross-
      regeneration and each transceiver is operated in an uni-
      directional mode.

   Due to the fact that 3R regenerators are composed of an optical
   transponder pair, the capabilitiy whether an optical transponder can
   be used as a 3R regenerator is is added to the transponder
   capabilities.  Hence, no additional entity is required for describing
   3R regenerators in the TE-topology YANG model.  The optical
   transonder capabilities regarding the 3R regenerator function are
   described by the following two YANG model attributes:

   o  supported-termination-type
   o  supported-3r-mode

   The supported-termination-type attribute describes whether the
   optical transponder can be used as tunnel terminating transponder
   only, as 3R regenerator only, or whether it can support both
   functions.  The supported-3r-mode attrbute describes the
   configuration of the transponder pair forming the 3R regeneartor as
   described above.

2.7.  WSS/Filter

   WSS separates the incoming light input spectrally as well as
   spatially, then chooses the wavelength that is of interest by
   deflecting it from the original optical path and then couple it to
   another optical fibre port.  WSS/Filter is internal to ROADM.  So
   this document does not model the inside of ROADM.

2.8.  Optical Fiber

   There are various optical fiber types defined by ITU-T.  There are
   several fiber-level parameters that need to be factored in, such as,
   fiber-type, length, loss coefficient, pmd, connectors (in/out).

   ITU-T G.652 defines Standard Singlemode Fiber; G.654 Cutoff Shifted
   Fiber; G.655 Non-Zero Dispersion Shifted Fiber; G.656 Non-Zero
   Dispersion for Wideband Optical Transport; G.657 Bend-Insensitive
   Fiber.  There may be other fiber-types that need to be considered.

2.9.  ROADM Node Architectures

   The ROADM node architectures in today's dense wavelength division
   multiplexing (DWDM) networks can be categorized as follows:

   o  Integrated ROADM architecture with integrated optical transponders

   o  Integrated ROADM architecture with integrated optical transponders
      and single channel add/drop ports for remote optical transponders

   o  Disaggregated ROADM architecture where the ROADM is subdivided
      into degree, add/drop, and optical transponder subsystems handled
      as separate network elements

   The TE topology YANG model augmentations including optical
   impairments for DWDM networks defined below intend to cover all the 3
   categories of ROADM architectures listed above.  In the case of a
   disaggregated ROADM architecture, it is assumed that optical domain
   controller already performs some form of abstraction and presents the
   TE-node representing the disaggregated ROADM in the same way as an
   integrated ROADM with integrated optical transponders if the optical
   transponder subsystems and the add/drop subsystems are collocated
   (short fiber links not imposing significant optical impairments).

   The different ROADM architectures are briefly described and
   illustrated in the following subsections.

   [Editor's note: The modeling of remote optical transponders located
   for example in the client device with a single channel link between
   the OT and the add/drop port of the ROADM requires further
   investigations and will be addressed in a future revision of this
   document.]

2.9.1.  Integrated ROADM Architecture with Integrated Optical
        Transponders

   Figure 2 and Figure 8 below show the typical architecture of an
   integrated ROADM node, which contains the optical transponders as an
   integral part of the ROADM node.  Such an integrated ROADM node
   provides DWDM interfaces as external interfaces for interconnecting
   the device with its neighboring ROADMs (see OTS link above).  The
   number of these interfaces denote also the degree of the ROADM.  A
   degree 3 ROADM for example has 3 DWDM links that interconnect the
   ROADM node with 3 neighboring ROADMs.  Additionally, the ROADM
   provides client interfaces for interconnecting the ROADM with client
   devices such as IP routers or Ethernet switches.  These client
   interfaces are the client interfaces of the integrated optical
   transponders.

2.9.2.  Integrated ROADMs with Integrated Optical Transponders and
        Single Channel Add/Drop Interfaces for Remote Optical
        Transponders

   Figure 9 below shows the extreme case where all optical transponders
   are not integral parts of the ROADM but are separate devices that are
   interconnected with add/drop ports of the ROADM.  If the optical
   transponders and the ROADM are collocated and if short single channel
   fiber links are used to interconnect the optical transponders with an
   add/drop port of the ROADM, the optical domain controller may present
   these optical transponders in the same way as integrated optical
   transponders.  If, however, the optical impairments of the single
   channel fiber link between the optical transponder and the add/drop
   port of the ROADM cannot be neglected, it is necessary to represent
   the fiber link with its optical impairments in the topology model
   This also implies that the optical transponders belong to a separate
   TE node

   [Editor's note: this requires further study].

2.9.3.  Disaggregated ROADMs Subdivided into Degree, Add/Drop, and
        Optical Transponder Subsystems

   Recently, some DWDM network operators started demanding ROADM
   subsystems from their vendors.  An example is the OpenROADM project
   where multiple operators and vendors are developing related YANG
   models.  The subsystems of a disaggregated ROADM are: single degree
   subsystems, add/drop subsystems and optical transponder subsystems.
   These subsystems separate network elements and each network element
   provides a separate management and control interface.  The subsystems
   are typically interconnected using short fiber patch cables and form
   together a disaggregated ROADM node.  This disaggregated ROADM
   architecture is depicted in Figure 10 below.

   As this document defines TE topology YANG model augmentations
   [RFC8795] for the TE topology YANG model provided at the north-bound
   interface of the optical domain controller, it is a valid assumption
   that the optical domain controller abstracts the subsystems of a
   disaggregated ROADM and presents the disaggregated ROADM in the same
   way as an integrated ROADM hiding all the interconnects that are not
   relevant from an external TE topology view.

2.9.4.  Optical Impairments Imposed by ROADM Nodes

   When an optical OTSi signal traverses a ROADM node, optical
   impairments are imposed on the signal by various passive or active
   optical components inside the ROADM node.  Examples of optical
   impairments are:

   o  Chromatic dispersion (CD)
   o  Polarization mode dispersion (PMD)
   o  Polarization dependent loss (PDL)

   o  Optical amplifier noise due to amplified spontaneous emission
      (ASE)
   o  In-band cross-talk
   o  Filtering effects (for further study)

   A ROADM node contains a wavelength selective photonic switching
   function (WSS)that is capable of switching media channels (MCs)
   described in Section 2.3.4.  These MCs can be established between two
   line ports of the ROADM or between a line port and an Add/Drop port
   of the ROADM.  The Add/Drop ports of a ROADM are those ports to which
   optical transponders are connected.  Typically, this is a single
   channel signal (single OTSi), but principally this could also be a
   group of OTSi signals.  The optical impairments associated with these
   MCs are different and the paths of the MCs inside the ROADM node can
   be categorized as follows:

   o  Express path: MC path between two line ports of the ROADM
      (unidirectional)

   o  Add Path: MC path from an Add port to a line port of the ROADM

   o  Drop path: MC path from a line port to a Drop port of the ROADM

   Due to the symmetrical architecture of the ROADM node, the optical
   impairments associated with the express path are typically the same
   between any two line ports of the ROADM whereas the optical
   impairments for the add and drop paths are different and therefore
   have to be modeled separately.

   The optical impairments associated with each of the three types of
   ROADM-node-internal paths described above are modeled as optical
   impairment parameter sets.  These parameter sets are modeled as an
   augmentation of the te-node-attributes defined in [RFC8795].  The te-
   node-attributes are augmented with a list of roadm-path-impairments
   for the three ROADM path types distinguished by the impairment-type.
   Each roadm-path-impairments list entry contains the set of optical
   impairment parameters for one of the three path types indicated by
   the impairment-type.  For the optical feasibility calculation based
   on the optical impairments, it is necessary to know whether the
   optical power of the OTSi stays within a certain power window.  This
   is reflected by some optical power related parameters such as loss
   parameters or power parameters, which are included in the optical
   impairment parameter sets (see tree view in Section 3).

   [RFC8795] defines a connectivity matrix and a local link connectivity
   list for the TE node.  The connectivity matrix describes the
   connectivity for the express paths between the different lines of the
   ROADM and the local link connectivity list describes the connectivity

   for the Add and Drop paths of the ROADM.  These matrices are
   augmented with a new roadm-path-impairment matrix element, an add-
   path-impairment, and drop-path-impairment matrix element,
   respectively, which are defined as a pointer to the corresponding
   entry in the roadm-path-impairments list (leaf-ref).

5.  Security Considerations

   The configuration, state, and action data defined in this document
   are designed to be accessed via a management protocol with a secure
   transport layer, such as NETCONF [RFC6241].  The NETCONF access
   control model [RFC8341] provides the means to restrict access for
   particular NETCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available
   NETCONF protocol operations and content.

   A number of configuration data nodes defined in this document are
   read-only; however, these data nodes may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments (TBD).

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers the following namespace URIs in the IETF XML
   registry [RFC3688]:

   --------------------------------------------------------------------
   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-optical-impairment-topology
   Registrant Contact: The IESG.
   XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.
   --------------------------------------------------------------------

   This document registers the following YANG modules in the YANG Module
   Names registry [RFC7950]:

   --------------------------------------------------------------------
   name:      ietf-optical-impairment-topology
   namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-optical-impairment-
   topology
   prefix:    optical-imp-topo
