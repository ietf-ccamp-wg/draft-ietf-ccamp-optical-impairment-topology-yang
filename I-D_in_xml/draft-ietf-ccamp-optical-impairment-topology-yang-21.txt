        A YANG Data Model for Optical Impairment-aware Topology
          draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang-21

Abstract

   In order to provision an optical connection through optical networks,
   a combination of path continuity, resource availability, and
   impairment constraints must be met to determine viable and optimal
   paths through the network.  The determination of appropriate paths is
   known as Impairment-Aware Routing and Wavelength Assignment (IA-RWA)
   for a Wavelength Switched Optical Network (WSON), while it is known
   as Impairment-Aware Routing and Spectrum Assignment (IA-RSA) for a
   Spectrum Switched Optical Network (SSON).

   This document provides a YANG data model for the impairment-aware
   Traffic Engineering topology (TE topology) in optical networks.  It
   augments the technology agnostic YANG Data Model for TE topologies.
   The topology YANG model provides read-only topology data including
   optical impairments that can be used for example by a Path
   Computation Engine (PCE) for calculating an optically feasible path
   for a new connection before it is established through an optical
   network.

1.  Introduction

   In order to provision an optical connection (an optical path) through
   wavelength switched optical networks (WSONs) as defined in [RFC9094]
   or spectrum switched optical networks (SSONs), a combination of path
   continuity, resource availability, and impairment constraints must be
   met to determine viable and optimal paths through the network.  The
   determination of appropriate paths is known as Impairment-Aware
   Routing and Wavelength Assignment (IA-RWA) [RFC6566] for WSON, while
   it is known as IA-Routing and Spectrum Assigment (IA-RSA) for SSON.

   An introduction to optical impairments and their impact on optical
   signals (degradation) is provided in [RFC6566].

Internet-Draft    Opt. Impairment-Aware Topo YANG Model    February 2026


   This document provides a YANG data model for the impairment-aware
   Traffic Engineering (TE) topology in WSONs and SSONs.  The YANG model
   described in this document is a WSON/SSON technology-specific YANG
   model based on the information model developed in [RFC7446] and the
   two encoding documents [RFC7581] and [RFC7579] that developed
   protocol independent encodings based on [RFC7446].

   The intent of this document is to provide a YANG data model, that can
   be utilized by a Multi-Domain Service Coordinator (MDSC) to collect
   WSON or SSON impairment data from the Provisioning Network
   Controllers (PNCs) to enable impairment-aware optical path
   computation according to the ACTN Architecture [RFC8453].  The
   communication between controllers is done via a NETCONF [RFC6241] or
   a RESTCONF interface [RFC8040].

   Optical data plane interoperability, particularly for optical
   transponders across multiple vendors, is a complex challenge that
   typically necessitates joint engineering regardless of control and
   management plane capabilities.  However, the YANG data model defined
   in this document provides the essential optical impairment data
   required for impairment-aware path computation including optical
   transponder interoperability if it exists.

   Optical data plane interoperability is outside the scope of this
   document.

   This document augments the generic TE topology YANG model defined in
   [RFC8795].

   The impairment-aware topology for a WSON/SSON network based on the
   YANG data model defined in this document is intended to be used for
   exposing the network topology including optical impairments.
   Therefore, the topology information that is typically provided by a
   PNC is assumed to be read-only data.  This may change when the same
   impairment-aware topology model is used for other optical network use
   cases than exposing the network topology.  For example, for a path
   computation engine, where topological elements could be added in the
   context of a what-if scenario analysis.  This is outside of the scope
   of this document.

   This document defines one YANG module: ietf-optical-impairment-
   topology (Section 3).

1.1.  Terminology

   Refer to [RFC6566], [RFC7698], and [G.807] for the key terms used in
   this document.

   The following terms are defined in [RFC7950] and are not redefined
   here:

   *  client

   *  server

   *  augment

   *  data model

   *  data node

   The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in
   [RFC7950].

   The term ROADM in this document refers to the term "multi-degree
   reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexer (MD-ROADM)" as defined in
   [G.672].  It does not include local optical transponders, which can
   be co-located in the same physical device (managed entity).

   The term WDM-node refers to a physical device, which is managed as a
   single network element.

   The term WDM-TE-node refers to those parts of a WDM-node (physical
   device) that are modeled as a TE-node as defined in [RFC8795], which
   may include a ROADM and/or multiple local optical transponders (OTs).
   Hence, a WDM-TE-node might only contain OTs.

   The term "WDM-TE-network" refers to a set of WDM-TE-nodes as defined
   above that are interconnected via TE-links carrying WDM signals.
   These TE-links may include optical amplifiers.

   The term "add/drop TE-link" refers to a TE-link representing the
   media channel between a transceiver's media port of a remote optical
   transponder (OT) and an add/drop port of the ROADM in the adjacent
   WDM-node.  The add/drop TE-link typically carries a single optical
   tributary signal (OTSi, i.e., a modulated optical carrier, see
   Section 2.3.1).

   The term "bundled add/drop TE-link" refers to the TE-link bundling
   concept as defined in [RFC8795].  Multiple component links, add/drop
   TE-links in this case, are bundled into a single bundled add/drop TE-
   Link.

   In the context of this document, the term "layer 0" refers to the
   photonic layer or WDM layer network in the architecture of the
   optical transport network (OTN) as defined in ITU-T Recommendation

   G.709 [G.709], ITU-T Recommendation G.872 [G.872], and ITU-T
   Recommendation G.807 [G.807] as opposed to the electrical switching
   layers of the OTN, which are typically referred to as layer 1 (L1).
   The term "layer 0" may also be used for other transport network
   technologies (e.g. copper-based, radio-based, or free space optics-
   based, etc.), which are outside the scope of this document.

   The term "muxponder" is a short for "multiplexer–transponder" and
   refers to a device used in optical networking, especially in DWDM
   (Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing) systems, to combine multiple
   client signals onto a single high-speed optical wavelength.

1.2.  Tree Diagram

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is used in
   Section 2 of this document.  The meaning of the symbols in these
   diagrams is defined in [RFC8340].

1.3.  Prefixes in Data Node Names

2.  Scope of this document and Data Plane Reference Architecture

2.1.  Scope of this document

   The impairment-aware topology YANG model for optical networks defined
   in this document is a network model as defined in [RFC8969].  The
   topology model provides read-only network topology status information
   that is typically used for path computation during service
   provisioning when a new service is established on the network.

   The model in this document does not provide device configuration
   capabilities.  Where those capabilities are needed, a device model as
   defined in [RFC8969] can be used: [I-D.ietf-ccamp-dwdm-if-param-yang]
   defines a device model for Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing
   (DWDM) interfaces.

2.2.  Optical Transport Network Data Plane

   This section provides a description of the optical transport network
   reference architecture and its relevant components and their optical
   impairments needed to support impairment-aware path computation.

   Figure 1 shows the reference architecture.

   BA (WDM-node 1) is the egress Amplifier and PA (WDM-node 2) is the
   ingress amplifier for the Optical Multiplex Section Media Channel
   Group (OMS MCG) [G.807] in the direction from left to right in
   Figure 1.

   According to [G.807], clause 3.2.4, a Media Channel Group (MCG)
   represents "a unidirectional point-to-point management/control
   abstraction that represents a set of one or more media channels that
   are co-routed.  A media channel group (MCG) is bounded by a pair of
   media ports."

2.3.  OTS and OMS Media Channel Group

   According to [G.807], an Optical Transmission Section Media Channel
   Group (OTS MCG) represents a topological construct between two
   adjacent amplifiers, such as:

     (i)  between a WDM-TE-node's BA and the adjacent ILA,
    (ii)  between a pair of ILAs,
   (iii)  between an ILA and the adjacent WDM-TE-node's PA.

Internet-Draft    Opt. Impairment-Aware Topo YANG Model    February 2026


   [G.807] defines an OMS MCG as "The topological relationship between
   the media port on a filter or coupler where a set of media channels
   are aggregated and the media port on a filter or coupler where one or
   more media channel is added to or removed from that aggregate.  All
   of the media channels that are represented by the OMS MCG must be
   carried over the same serial concatenation of OTS MCGs and
   amplifiers."

   An OMS MCG originates at the ROADM in the source WDM-node and
   terminates at the ROADM in the destination WDM-node traversing the
   Booster Amplifier (BA) and the Pre-Amplifier (PA) in the WDM-nodes as
   well as the In-Line Amplifiers (ILAs) between the two WDM-nodes.

   An OMS MCG can be decomposed into a sequence of OTS MCGs and
   amplifiers.

   An OMS MCG traverses a sequence of optical elements between the ROADM
   function of two adjacent WDM-nodes as depicted in Figure 1 where the
   OMS MCG is terminated.  These elements can be in the transmit
   direction: a Booster Amplifier (BA), one or more fiber sections with
   in-line amplifiers (ILAs), and a Pre-Amplifier (PA).  A concentrated
   loss element can be used to describe an insertion loss caused, for
   example, by a fiber connector along the sequence of optical elements.

   In TE-topology terms, the OMS MCG is modeled as a WDM TE-link
   interconnecting two WDM-TE-nodes.  A network controller can retrieve
   the optical impairment data for all the WDM TE-link elements defined
   in the layer-0 topology YANG model.

   The optical impairments related to the link between remote optical
   transponders, located in a different WDM-TE-node (an IP router with
   integrated optical transponders for example), can also be modeled as
   a WDM TE-link using the same optical impairments as those defined for
   a WDM TE-link between WDM-TE-nodes (OMS MCG).  In this scenario, the
   node containing the remote optical transponders can be considered as
   WDM-TE-node with termination capability only and no switching
   capabilities.

   A WDM TE-link is terminated on both ends by a link termination point
   (LTP) as defined in [RFC8795].  Links between WDM nodes in optical
   transport networks are typically bidirectional.  Generally, they have
   different impairments in the two directions and hence they MUST be
   modeled as a pair of two unidirectional TE-links following the
   [RFC8795] modeling approach.  Unlike TE-links, which are
   unidirectional, the LTPs on either end of the TE-link pair forming
   the bidirectional link, are bidirectional as described in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-te-topo-and-tunnel-modeling] and the pair of
   unidirectional links are connected to the same bidirectional LTP on
   either end of the link pair.

2.3.1.  Optical Tributary Signal (OTSi)

   The OTSi is defined in ITU-T Recommendation G.959.1, section 3.2.4
   [G.959.1] as "Optical signal that is placed within a network media
   channel for transport across the optical network.  This may consist
   of a single modulated optical carrier or a group of modulated optical
   carriers or subcarriers."  The YANG model defined in Section 3
   assumes that a single OTSi consists of a single modulated optical
   carrier.  This single modulated optical carrier conveys digital
   information.  Characteristics of the OTSi signal are modulation
   scheme (e.g. QPSK, 8-QAM, 16-QAM, etc.), baud rate (measure of the
   symbol rate), pulse shaping (e.g. raised cosine - complying with the
   Nyquist inter symbol interference criterion), etc.

   Path computation needs to know the existing OTSi signals for each OMS
   link in the topology to determine the optical impairment impact of
   the existing OTSi signals on the optical feasibility of a new OTSi
   signal and vice versa, i.e., the impact of the new OTSi on the
   existing OTSi signals.  For determining the optical feasibility of
   the new OTSi, it is necessary to know the OTSi properties like
   carrier frequency, baud rate, and signal power for all existing OTSi
   signals on each OMS link.

   Additionally, it is necessary for each WDM-TE-node in the network to
   know the OTSi signals that are added to or dropped from a WDM TE-link
   (OMS MCG) link as well as the optical power of these OTSi signals to
   check whether the WDM-TE-node's optical power constraints are met.

   The impairment-aware topology YANG model for optical networks in
   Section 3 defines the optical OTSi properties needed for impairment-
   aware path computation including the spectrum occupied by each OTSi
   signal.  The model also defines a pointer (leafref) from the OTSi to
   the transceiver module terminating the OTSi signal.

   The OTSi signals in the YANG model are described by augmenting the
   network and each OTSi signal is uniquely identified by its otsi-
   carrier-id, which is unique within the scope of the OTSiG (see
   Section 2.3.2 below) the OTSi belongs to.

2.3.2.  Optical Tributary Signal Group (OTSiG)

   The OTSiG is defined in ITU-T Recommendation G.807 [G.807] as a "set
   of optical tributary signals (OTSi) that supports a single digital
   client".  Hence, the OTSiG is an electrical signal that is carried by
   one or more OTSi's.  The relationship between the OTSiG and the
   OTSi's is described in [G.807], section 10.2.  The YANG model in
   Section 3 supports both cases: the single OTSi case where the OTSiG
   contains a single OTSi (see [G.807], Figure 10-2) and the multiple
   OTSi case where the OTSiG consists of more than one OTSi (see
   [G.807], Figure 10-3).  From a layer 0 topology YANG model
   perspective, the OTSiG is a logical construct that associates the
   OTSi's, which belong to the same OTSiG.  The typical application of
   an OTSiG consisting of more than one OTSi is inverse multiplexing.
   Constraints exist for the OTSi's belonging to the same OTSiG such as:
   (i) all OTSi's must be co-routed over the same optical fibers and
   nodes and (ii) the differential delay between the different OTSi's
   may not exceed a certain limit.  Example: a 400Gbps client signal may
   be carried by 4 OTSi's where each OTSi carries 100Gbps of client
   traffic.

   All OTSiGs are described in the YANG model by augmenting the network
   and each OTSiG is uniquely identified by its otsi-group-id, which is
   unique within the network.  Each OTSiG also contains a list of the
   OTSi signals belonging to the OTSiG.

2.3.3.  Media Channel (MC)

   [G.807] defines a "media channel" as "A media association that
   represents both the topology (i.e., the path through the media) and
   the resource (i.e., frequency slot or effective frequency slot) that
   it occupies."  In this document, the term "channel" is occasionally
   used to indicate the resource of an MC (i.e., frequency slot or
   effective frequency slot), without representing topology.

   In this document, an end-to-end MC is defined as a type of MC, which
   is formed by the serial concatenation of all the MCs from source
   transceiver media ports to destination transceiver media ports.  This
   end-to-end MC is defined across all the ROADM nodes along the end-to-
   end optical path with the same nominal central frequency n and
   frequency slot of width m, which represents the effective frequency
   slot of the end-to-end MC.  An end-to-end MC can carry a single OTSi,
   or multiple OTSi signals belonging to the same OTSiG.

   [G.807_Amd1] defines a "network media channel (NMC)" as "a type of
   media channel that is formed by the serial concatenation of all media
   channels between the media port of a modulator and the media port of
   a demodulator".  The modulator and demodulator are integral functions
   of a transceiver and their media ports do not necessarily coincide
   with the media port of the transceiver, which is associated with the
   transceiver's physical optical port.  Due to this difference, the
   end-to-end MC is used in this document based on the definition in the
   previous paragraph.

   In Section 2.11, the term "end-to-end MC path" is used to describe
   the topological aspect of the end-to-end MC, i.e., the path through
   the media (see: [G.807_Amd1], section 7.1.2).  This is in line with
   the TE path defined in [RFC8795], section 3.9, where the TE path is
   defined as "an ordered list of TE links and/or TE nodes on the TE
   topology graph" interconnecting a pair of tunnel termination points
   (TTPs).

       Figure 3: MC Example containing both OTSi signals of an OTSiG

   The frequency slot of the MC is defined by the n value defining the
   central frequency of the MC and the m value that defines the width of
   the MC following the flexible grid definition in [G.694.1].  In this
   model, the effective frequency slot as defined in [G.807] is equal to
   the frequency slot of this MC.  It is also assumed that ROADM devices
   can switch MCs.  For various reasons (e.g. differential delay), it is
   preferred to use a single MC for all OTSi's of the same OTSiG.  It
   may however not always be possible to find a single MC for carrying
   all OTSi's of an OTSiG due to spectrum occupation along the OTSiG
   path.

2.3.4.  Media Channel Group (MCG)

   ITU-T [G.807] defines the Media Channel Group MCG as "A
   unidirectional point to point management/control abstraction that
   represents a set of one or more media channels that are co-routed."
   The YANG model in Section 3 assumes that the MCG is a logical
   grouping of one or more MCs that are used to carry all OTSi's
   belonging to the same OTSiG.

   The MCG can be considered as an association of MCs without defining a
   hierarchy where each MC is defined by its (n,m) value pair.  An MCG
   consists of more than one MC when no single MC can be found from
   source to destination that is wide enough to accommodate all OTSi's
   (modulated carriers) that belong to the same OTSiG.  In such a case
   the set of OTSi's belonging to a single OTSiG must be split across 2
   or more MCs.

   The MCG is relevant for path computation because all end-to-end MCs
   belonging to the same MCG MUST be co-routed, i.e., MUST follow the
   same path.  Additional constraints may exist (e.g. differential
   delay).

2.4.  Optical Amplifiers

   Optical amplifiers are used in WDM networks for amplifying the
   optical signal in the optical domain without any optical to
   electrical and electrical to optical conversion.  Three major optical
   amplifier technologies are existing at the time of writing:

   *  Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifiers (EDFAs)
   *  Raman Amplifiers
   *  Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers (SOAs)

   In today's WDM networks EDFAs and Raman amplifiers are widely used.
   Raman amplifiers have become attractive due to their large spectral
   gain bandwidth, which can be quite flat, with similar or even lower
   noise figures compared to EDFAs.  On the other hand, Raman amplifiers
   consume more power and are usually more expensive than EDFAs.

   Raman amplifiers are distributed amplifiers where an optical pump
   signal is injected typically in opposite direction to the optical
   signal that is amplified (backward pump, counter-propagating pump
   light).  Injecting the optical pump signal in the same direction is
   also possible (forward pump, co-propagating pump light).  For optical
   amplifiers, the YANG model defines Raman pump light attributes



Beller, et al.           Expires 17 August 2026                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft    Opt. Impairment-Aware Topo YANG Model    February 2026


   describing the direction (raman-direction) with respect to the signal
   that is amplified and optical frequency and power for the pump light
   source(s) contained in the raman-pump list.  These Raman amplifier-
   specific attributes are optional as they are only applicable to Raman
   amplifiers.  For determining the optical amplifier type, i.e., to
   figure out whether an optical amplifier is a Raman amplifier, the
   type-variety attribute is used.  Due to the distributed nature of the
   Raman amplifier it is difficult to clearly separate the amplifier
   from the fiber span into which the pump signal is injected.  From a
   topology modeling perspective, the Raman amplifier is modeled as two
   OMS line elements:

   1.  a passive fiber element accounting for the fiber loss only and
       not the resulting loss including the Raman gain

   2.  an amplifier element providing all optical amplifier properties
       (gain, tilt, etc.).  On the OMS-link, the amplifier element is
       placed where the pump is located and the geolocation information
       also indicates the location of the pump.

   Amplifiers can be classified according to their location along the
   TE-link (OMS MCG).  There are three basic amplifier types: In-Line
   Amplifiers (ILAs), Pre-Amplifiers and Booster Amplifiers.  ILAs are
   separate physical devices while Pre-Amplifiers and Booster Amplifiers
   are integral elements of a WDM-node.  From a data modeling
   perspective, node-internal details should not be modeled and should
   be abstracted as much as possible.  For Pre-Amplifiers and Booster
   Amplifiers, however, a different approach has been taken, and they
   are modeled as TE-link elements as they have the same optical
   impairments as ILAs.

   ILAs may have a variable optical attenuator on the ingress side (in-
   voa attribute) allowing control of the input power of the WDM signal
   (OMS MCG) entering the gain stage of the ILA.  It may also have a
   variable optical attenuator on the egress side, which allows control
   of the optical power of the WDM output signal (OMS MCG) of the ILA.
   The actual-gain attribute reflects the gain of the ILA gain stage and
   does not include the attenuation of the in-voa and/or out-voa.

   To support the modeling of multi-band (e.g., C + L band) and multi-
   stage (cascaded) amplifiers as depicted in Figure 5, the OMS element
   that describes an optical amplifier may contain an unordered list of
   amplifier-elements.  The position of the element is based on the
   following attributes:

   *  lower-frequency and upper-frequency describing the frequency band
      the set of amplifier-elements are operating in.




Beller, et al.           Expires 17 August 2026                [Page 15]

Internet-Draft    Opt. Impairment-Aware Topo YANG Model    February 2026


   *  stage-order describing the sequential order of the cascaded
      amplifier-elements for the frequency band.

   The detailed representation of the amplifier stages is not always
   mandatory.  Abstraction is allowed as long as the optical impairments
   of the multi-stage amplifier are modeled properly.  For example, the
   detailed representation of the cascaded elements is needed in case
   the amplifier supports both amplification of the signal as well as
   the DGE function described in Section 2.5.

   Multi-band amplifiers like the dual-band amplifier depicted in
   Figure 5 have a band-separating filter at the input and a band-
   combining multiplexer combining all the bands at the output.  These
   filter and multiplexer functions are not modeled explicitly and their
   optical impairments are subsumed in the optical impairments of the
   amplifier components.

      Figure 5: Example of a Dual-band, Multi-stage Amplifier with DGE
                               Functionality

   ILAs are placed at locations where the optical amplification of the
   WDM signal is required on the TE-link (OMS MCG) between two WDM-TE-
   nodes.  Geolocation information is already defined for TE nodes in
   [RFC8795] and is also beneficial for ILAs.  Therefore, the same
   geolocation container has been added to the amplifier element on an
   OMS link containing altitude, latitude, and longitude as optional
   attributes.

2.5.  Dynamic Gain Equalizers

   A Dynamic Gain Equalizer (DGE) is optical equipment that is capable
   of adjusting the optical power on a per-channel basis in order to
   compensate the channel power variation as a result of variable gain
   or loss the DWDM signals experienced while propagating through the
   network.  The channel power can be configured explicitly or in the
   form of power-spectral-density.

2.6.  Transponders

   A transponder is optical equipment that sends and receives the
   optical signal from a DWDM network.  A transponder can have one or
   more transceiver modules.  A transceiver represents a transmitter and
   its corresponding receiver (Tx/Rx pair) as defined in ITU-T
   Recommendation G.698.2 [G.698.2].  In addition to the transceiver,
   which is terminating an OTSi signal, a transponder typically provides
   additional layer 1 functionality such as, for example, aggregation
   (multiplexing) of client traffic from multiple input ports into a
   single OTSi signal, which is outside the scope of this document
   addressing optical layer 0 aspects of transponders.

   The termination of an OTSi signal by a transceiver is modeled as a
   function of the tunnel termination point (TTP) as defined in
   [RFC8795].  Because optical transport services (TE tunnels) are
   typically bidirectional, a TTP is also modeled as a bidirectional
   entity like the LTP described in Section 2.3.  Moreover, a TTP can
   terminate one or several OTSiG signals (tunnels) as described in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-te-topo-and-tunnel-modeling] and each OTSiG consists
   of one or multiple OTSi signals as described in Section 2.3.2.
   Therefore, a TTP can be associated with multiple transceivers.

   A transponder is typically characterized by its data/symbol rate and
   the maximum distance the signal can travel.  Other transponder
   properties are for example but are not limited to: carrier frequency
   range for the optical channel, output power per channel, measured
   input power, modulation scheme, Forward Error Correction (FEC), etc.

   From a path computation perspective, the selection of the compatible
   configuration of the source and the destination transceivers is an
   important factor for optical signals to traverse through the DWDM
   network.

   The YANG model defines three different approaches to describe the
   transceiver capabilities (called "modes") that are needed to
   determine optical signal compatibility:

   *  Standard Modes

   *  Organizational Modes

   *  Explicit Modes

2.6.1.  Standard Modes

   A standard mode is related to an optical specification developed by a
   Standards Development Organization (SDO).  Currently, the "Standard
   Modes" can only be referred to ITU-T Recommendation G.698.2 [G.698.2]
   since ITU-T Recommendation G.698.2 is the only standard defining
   "Standard Modes" today.  Nothing is precluding, however,
   consideration of other specifications provided by any other SDO in
   the Standard Mode context as soon as such specifications might be
   available.  An application code as defined in ITU-T G.698.2 [G.698.2]
   represents a standard ITU-T G.698.2 optical interface specification
   towards the realization of transversely compatible DWDM systems that
   it is a standard that ensures transceivers from different vendors can
   work together in a DWDM network.  Two transceivers supporting the
   same application code and a line system matching the constraints,
   defined in ITU-T G.698.2, for that application code will
   interoperate.  As the characteristics are encoded in the application
   code, the YANG model in this document only defines a string, which
   represents that application code.

   For the standard modes, some additional attributes are defined.  The
   most important one is the line-coding-bitrate attribute, which was
   added because [G.698.2] lists 100gpbs application codes supporting
   two data formats, an OTU4 related data format and a Flex-O related
   data format.  The supported data formats for an application code can
   be described by listing the supported data formats via the line-
   coding-bitrate attribute as a transceiver capability.

Internet-Draft    Opt. Impairment-Aware Topo YANG Model    February 2026


   Moreover, the transceiver properties like optical carrier frequency
   range, optical carrier tunability, and transmitter/receiver optical
   power ranges can be described as optional attributes in case they
   differ from the specification for the standard mode, i.e., as defined
   in [G.698.2].  A transceiver may support extended optical frequency
   ranges or optical power ranges or a finer optical carrier tunability.
   These capabilities can be described explicitly if needed.

2.6.2.  Organizational Modes

   Organizations like operator groups, industry fora, or equipment
   vendors can define their own optical interface specifications and
   make use of transceiver capabilities going beyond existing standards.

   An organizational mode is identified by the organization-identifier
   attribute defining the scope and an operational-mode that is
   meaningful within the scope of the organization.  Hence, the two
   attributes MUST always be considered together.  It is the
   responsibility of the organization to assign operational modes and to
   ensure that operational modes are unique and unambiguous within the
   scope of the organization.

   Two transceivers can be interconnected, if they have at least one
   (organization-identifier, operational-mode) pair in common and if the
   supported carrier frequency and power attributes have a matching
   range.  This is a necessary condition for path computation in the
   context of organizational modes.

   An operational mode is a transceiver preset (a configuration with
   well-defined parameter values) subsuming several transceiver
   properties defined by the optical interface specification - these
   properties are not provided for an operational mode and are therefore
   not defined in the YANG model.  Examples of these properties are:

   *  FEC type

   *  Modulation scheme

   *  Encoding (mapping of bit patterns (code words) to symbols in the
      constellation diagram)

   *  Baud rate (symbol rate)

   *  Carrier bandwidth (typically measured in GHz)

   The major reason for these transceiver presets is the fact that the
   attribute values typically cannot be configured independently and are
   therefore advertised as supported operational mode capabilities.  It



Beller, et al.           Expires 17 August 2026                [Page 19]

Internet-Draft    Opt. Impairment-Aware Topo YANG Model    February 2026


   is the responsibility of the organization to assign operational modes
   and to ensure that operational modes are unique and not ambiguous
   within the scope of the organization.

   In addition to the transceiver properties subsumed by the operational
   mode, optical power and carrier frequency related properties are
   modeled separately, i.e., outside of the operational mode.  This
   modeling approach allows transponders using different transceiver
   variants (e.g. optical modules) with slightly different power and/or
   frequency range properties to interoperate without defining separate
   operational modes.  Different optical modules (pluggables) from
   different suppliers typically have slightly different input and
   output power ranges or may have slightly different carrier frequency
   tuning ranges.

   The received channel power and the received total power are two
   parameters that can be measured by the receiver and can be provided
   by the transceiver in order to allow a controller to determine the
   expected performance of the end-to-end service taking into account
   the optical impairments along the path.

   An organization MAY define the operational modes to include the
   optical power and carrier frequency related properties following the
   application code approach as defined in ITU-T Recommendation G.698.2
   [G.698.2].  In such a case, the explicit optical power and carrier
   frequency related optional attributes should be omitted in order to
   avoid redundant information in the description of the transceiver
   capabilities.  If these attributes are provided in addition to the
   operational modes including these attribute values implicitly, the
   parameter values provided explicitly replace the implicit values and
   take precedence.  This should, however, only be done in exceptional
   cases and should be avoided whenever possible.  In case an implicitly
   given range is extended utilizing the explicit optional attributes, a
   path computation policy rule may be applied to select a value
   preferably from the range defined implicitly and to only select a
   value from the extended range if no path can be found for values in
   the implicitly defined range.  Path computation policy is outside the
   scope of this topology YANG model.

   In summary, the optical power and carrier frequency related
   attributes shall either be described implicitly by the operational
   mode following the definition provided by that organization or shall
   be described explicitly when the optical power and carrier frequency
   related properties are not included in the operational mode
   definition.

2.6.3.  Explicit Modes

   The explicit mode allows the encoding, explicitly, of any subset of
   parameters e.g., FEC type, Modulation type, etc., to enable a
   controller entity to check for interoperability by means outside of
   this document.  It shall be noted that using the explicit encoding
   does not guarantee interoperability between two transceivers even in
   case of identical parameter definitions.  The explicit mode shall
   therefore be used with care, but it could be useful when no common
   Application Codes or Organizational Modes exist or the constraints of
   common Application Codes or Organizational Modes cannot be met by the
   line system.

2.6.4.  Transponder Capabilities and Current Configuration

   The YANG model described in Section 3 defines the optical transceiver
   properties.  They are divided between:

   a.  Optical transceiver capabilities, describing how it can be
       configured

   b.  Current transceiver setting, indicating how it is currently
       configured

   The transceiver capabilities are described by the set of modes the
   transceiver is supporting.  Each mode must follow only one of the
   three mode options defined in Section 2.6.1, Section 2.6.2, and
   Section 2.6.3 (choice in the YANG model).  The YANG model allows the
   description of the transceiver capabilities by mixing different
   modes.  A transceiver may support some ITU-T application codes and in
   addition some organizational or explicit modes.

   A transceiver mode description comprises the following properties:

   *  Supported transmitter tuning range with min/max nominal carrier
      frequency [f_tx_min, f_tx_max]

   *  Supported transceiver tunability describing the transmitter's
      frequency fine tuning granularity (the minimum distance between
      two adjacent carrier frequencies in GHz)

   *  Supported transmitter power range [p_tx-min, p_tx_max]

   *  Supported receiver channel power range [p_rx-min, p_rx_max]

   *  Supported maximum total power, rx power for all channels fed into
      the receiver

Internet-Draft    Opt. Impairment-Aware Topo YANG Model    February 2026


   These optical transceiver properties are explicitly defined in the
   model for explicit and organizational modes, while they are
   implicitly defined for the application codes (see ITU-T G698.2
   [G.698.2]).

   The set of optical impairment limits, e.g., min optical signal to
   noise ratio (OSNR), max polarization mode dispersion (PMD),max
   chromatic dispersion (CD), max polarization dependent loss (PDL),
   quality factor (Q-factor) limit, are explicitly defined for the
   explicit modes while they are defined implicitly for the application
   codes and organizational modes.

   The model provides information about the maximum accumulated
   impairments supported by the transceiver modes (i.e., max-chromatic-
   dispersion, max-polarization-dependent-loss, max-polarization-mode-
   dispersion, max-diff-group-delay).  For CD, PMD and PDL impairments,
   the model also supports the option to provide more detailed OSNR
   penalties as a function of the accumulated impairments (i.e., cd-
   penalty, pmd-penalty and pdl-penalty).  In this case the attributes
   providing the maximum accumulated impairments MAY be omitted and the
   maximum accumulated impairment MUST be listed in the penalty list.
   In case both are present, there MUST NOT be any value in the penalty
   list above the maximum accumulated impairment.

   It is possible that the set of parameter values defined for an
   explicit mode may also be represented in form of an organizational
   mode or one or more application codes.  The "compatible-modes"
   container may provide two different lists with pointers to
   application codes and organizational modes, respectively.

   The current transponder configuration describes the properties of the
   OTSi transmitted or received by the transceiver attached to a
   specific transponder port.

   Each OTSi has the following three pointer attributes modeled as
   leafrefs:

   *  Pointer to the transponder instance containing the transceiver
      terminating the OTSi

   *  Pointer to the transceiver instance terminating the OTSi

   *  Pointer to the currently configured transceiver mode

   Additionally, the OTSi is described by the following frequency and
   optical power related attributes:

   *  current carrier-frequency

   *  currently transmitted channel power

   *  currently received channel power

   *  currently received total power

2.7.  3R Regenerators

   Optical transponders are usually used to terminate a layer 0 tunnel
   (layer 0 service) in the WDM layer.  If, however, no optical path can
   be found from the source transponder to the destination transponder
   that is optically feasible due to the optical impairments, one or
   more 3R regenerators are needed for regenerating the optical signal
   in intermediate nodes.  The term "3R" regenerator means:
   reamplification, reshaping, retiming.  As described in [G.807],
   Appendix IV, a 3R regenerator terminates the OTSi and generates a new
   OTSi.  Depending on the 3R regenerator capabilities, it can provide
   functions such as carrier frequency translation (carrier-frequency),
   changes in the modulation scheme (modulation-type) and FEC (FEC-type)
   while passing through the digital signal except the FEC (the FEC is
   processed and errors are corrected).

   The 3R regeneration compound function is illustrated in section 10.1
   of [G.798.1], and sections 10.3 and 10.4 provide examples of a ROADM
   architecture and a photonic cross-connect architecture including 3R
   regenerators.  Based on the functionality provided, 3R regenerators
   are considered as topological layer 0 entities because they are
   needed for layer 0 path computation in case the optical impairments
   make it impossible to find an optically feasible end-to-end path from
   the source transponder to the destination transponder without 3R
   regeneration.  When an end-to-end path includes one or more 3R
   regenerators, the corresponding layer 0 tunnel is subdivided into 2
   or more segments between the source transponder and the destination
   transponder terminating the layer 0 tunnel.

   3R regenerators are usually realized by a pair of optical
   transponders, which are described in Section 2.6.  If a pair of
   optical transponders is used to perform a 3R regeneratator function,
   two different configurations are possible involving the pair of
   optical transceivers of the two optical transponders:

   *  The two transponders can be operated in a back-to-back
      configuration where the transceiver of each optical transponder
      receives and transmits the optical signal from/to the same segment
      of the end-to-end tunnel.  This means that each transceiver is
      operated in a bi-directional mode.

               Figure 6: Back-to-back 3R Regenerator Example

   *  The two transponders can be operated in a configuration where each
      transponder performs the 3R regeneration function in one
      direction, one in forward direction (from source to destination)
      and the other in the reverse direction.  In this configuration,
      the transceiver of each optical transponder receives the signal
      from one segment and transmits the regenerated optical signal into
      the adjacent segment.  This configuration is also called cross-
      regeneration and each transceiver is operated in a uni-directional
      mode.

      Implementations MAY support the change of the carrier frequency
      where the receiver may operate at a different optical frequency
      than the transmitter.  The transceiver mode is a property of the
      transceiver and is applied to the transmitter and the receiver.
      Therefore, the transceiver mode is the same for the two segments
      on the two sides of the 3R regeneratator realized by two
      transceivers operated in the uni-directional mode.

   Since 3R regenerators are composed of an optical transponder pair,
   the capability that an optical transponder can be used as a 3R
   regenerator is added to the transponder capabilities.  Hence, no
   additional entity is required for describing 3R regenerators in the
   TE-topology YANG model.  The optical transponder capabilities
   regarding the 3R regenerator function are described by the following
   two YANG model attributes:

   *  supported-termination-type

   *  supported-3r-mode

Internet-Draft    Opt. Impairment-Aware Topo YANG Model    February 2026


   The supported-termination-type attribute describes whether the
   optical transponder can be used as tunnel terminating transponder
   only, as 3R regenerator only, or whether it can support both
   functions.  The supported-3r-mode attribute describes the
   configuration of the transponder pair forming the 3R regenerator.

2.8.  Wavelength Selective Switch (WSS)/Filter

   A WSS is a device that dynamically routes individual wavelengths from
   a common input fiber to any of several output ports without
   converting them into electrical signals.  The WSS/Filter is internal
   to a ROADM device.  This document does not model the internals of a
   ROADM's WSS.

2.9.  Optical Fiber

   There are various optical fiber types defined by ITU-T.  For optical
   feasibility calculation, several fiber-level parameters need to be
   taken into account, such as, fiber-type, length, loss coefficient,
   PMD, connectors (in/out).

   The loss of a fiber span can be described in two ways:

   i.   As calculated loss using the provided loss coefficient (loss-
        coef) and length of the fiber.

   ii.  As measured loss provided by the total-loss attribute.

   The total-loss SHOULD be provided when it can be measured with a
   power measurement facility at the output of the upstream node (input
   of the fiber span) and a power measurement facility at the input of
   the downstream node (output of the fiber span).  This measured loss
   typically differs from the calculated loss because it includes all
   loss contributions including possible accumulated loss due to
   imperfect fiber splices and connector losses.  It can also change
   over time due to changing fiber conditions, e.g., in case of a fiber
   cut.  In case the total-loss cannot be measured (no power measurement
   facilities in place), the total-loss defined as optional leaf in the
   YANG model SHALL be omitted.

   N.B.: In case of Raman amplifiers, the Raman gain SHALL NOT be
   included in the measured loss to properly reflect only the loss of
   the fiber span in the total-loss attribute.

   ITU-T G.652 defines Standard Singlemode Fiber; G.654 Cutoff Shifted
   Fiber; G.655 Non-Zero Dispersion Shifted Fiber; G.656 Non-Zero
   Dispersion for Wideband Optical Transport; G.657 Bend-Insensitive
   Fiber.  There may be other fiber-types that need to be considered.

2.10.  WDM-node Architectures

   The WDM-node architectures in today's dense wavelength division
   multiplexing (DWDM) networks can be categorized as follows:

   *  Integrated WDM-node architecture with local optical transponders

   *  Integrated WDM-node architecture with local optical transponders
      and single channel add/drop ports for remote optical transponders

   *  Disaggregated WDM-node architecture where the WDM-TE-node is
      composed of degree, add/drop, and optical transponder subsystems
      handled as separate WDM-nodes

   The TE topology YANG model augmentations for DWDM networks including
   optical impairments defined in Section 3 intends to cover all the 3
   categories of WDM-node architectures listed above.  In the case of a
   disaggregated WDM-node architecture, it is assumed that the optical
   domain controller already performs some form of abstraction and
   presents the WDM-TE-node representing the disaggregated WDM-nodes in
   the same way as an integrated WDM-TE-node with local optical
   transponders if the optical transponder subsystems and the add/drop
   subsystems are co-located (short fiber links are not imposing any
   significant optical impairments).

   The different WDM-node architectures are briefly described and
   illustrated in the following subsections.

2.10.1.  Integrated WDM-node Architecture with Local Optical
         Transponders

   Figure 1 and Figure 8 below show the typical architecture of an
   integrated WDM-node, which contains the optical transponders as an
   integral part of the WDM-node.  Such an integrated WDM-node provides
   DWDM interfaces as external interfaces for interconnecting the device
   with its neighboring WDM-node (see OMS MCG in Figure 1).  The number
   of these interfaces denote also the degree of the WDM-node.  A degree
   3 WDM-node for example has 3 DWDM links that interconnect the WDM-
   node with 3 neighboring WDM-nodes.  Additionally, the WDM-node
   provides client interfaces for interconnecting the WDM-node with
   client devices such as IP routers or Ethernet switches.  These client
   interfaces are the client interfaces of the integrated optical
   transponders.

2.10.2.  Integrated WDM-node with Integrated Optical Transponders and
         Single Channel Add/Drop Interfaces for Remote Optical
         Transponders

   Figure 9 below shows the extreme case where all optical transponders
   are not integral parts of the WDM-node but are separate devices that
   are connected to the add/drop ports of the WDM-node.  If the optical
   transponders and the WDM-node are co-located and if short single
   channel fiber links are used to interconnect the optical transponders
   with an add/drop port of the WDM-node, the optical domain controller
   MAY present these optical transponders in the same way as local
   optical transponders.  If, however, the optical impairments of the
   single channel fiber link between the optical transponder and the
   add/drop port of the WDM-node cannot be neglected, it is necessary to
   represent the fiber link with its optical impairments in the topology
   model.  This also implies that the optical transponders belong to a
   separate TE-node.

   Appendix C provides a modeling example for a configuration where the
   optical transponders and the ROADM are different WDM-TE-nodes (remote
   OT configuration).

   Some DWDM network operators are demanding WDM subsystems from their

   multiple operators and vendors are developing related YANG models.
   The subsystems of a disaggregated WDM-TE-node are:

   *  Single degree subsystems

   *  Add/drop subsystems

   *  Optical transponder subsystems

   These subsystems are separate network elements and each network
   element provides a separate management and control interface.  The
   subsystems are typically interconnected using short fiber patch
   cables and form together a disaggregated WDM-TE-node.  This
   disaggregated WDM-TE-node architecture is depicted in Figure 10
   below.

   As this document defines TE topology YANG model augmentations for the
   TE topology YANG model [RFC8795] provided at the north-bound
   interface of the optical domain controller, it is a valid assumption
   that the optical domain controller abstracts the subsystems of a

   in the same way as an integrated WDM-node hiding all the

2.10.4.  Optical Impairments Imposed by WDM-TE-nodes

   When an optical OTSi signal traverses a ROADM node, optical
   impairments are imposed on the signal by various passive or active
   optical components inside the ROADM node.  Examples of optical
   impairments are:

   *  Chromatic dispersion (CD)

   *  Polarization mode dispersion (PMD)

   *  Polarization dependent loss (PDL)

   *  Optical amplifier noise due to amplified spontaneous emission
      (ASE)

   *  In-band cross-talk

   *  Filtering effects (out of scope of this document)

   A ROADM node contains a wavelength selective photonic switching
   function (WSS)that can switch media channels (MCs) described in
   Section 2.3.4.  These MCs can be established between two line ports
   of the ROADM or between a line port and an Add/Drop port of the
   ROADM.  The Add/Drop ports of a ROADM are those ports to which
   optical transponders are connected.  Typically, add/drop ports are
   used for a single optical channel signal (single OTSi), but
   principally this could also be a group of OTSi signals (OTSiG).  The
   optical impairments associated with these MCs are different and the
   paths of the MCs inside the ROADM node can be categorized as follows:

   *  Express path: MC path between two line ports of the ROADM
      (unidirectional)

   *  Add Path: MC path from an Add port to a line port of the ROADM

   *  Drop path: MC path from a line port to a Drop port of the ROADM

   Due to the symmetrical architecture of the ROADM node, the optical
   impairments associated with the express path are typically the same
   between any two line ports of the ROADM whereas the optical
   impairments for the add and drop paths are different and therefore
   MUST be modeled separately.

   The optical impairments associated with each of the three types of
   ROADM-node-internal paths listed above are modeled as optical
   impairment parameter sets.  These parameter sets are modeled as an
   augmentation of the te-node-attributes defined in [RFC8795].  The te-

Internet-Draft    Opt. Impairment-Aware Topo YANG Model    February 2026


   node-attributes are augmented with a list of roadm-path-impairments
   for the three ROADM path types distinguished by the impairment-type.
   Each roadm-path-impairments list entry contains the set of optical
   impairment parameters for one of the three path types indicated by
   the impairment-type.  For the optical feasibility calculation based
   on the optical impairments, it is necessary to know whether the
   optical power of the OTSi stays within a certain power window.  This
   is reflected by some optical power related parameters such as loss
   parameters or power parameters (see also [G.680]), which are included
   in the optical impairment parameter sets (see tree view in
   Appendix A).

   [RFC8795] defines a connectivity matrix and a local link connectivity
   list for the TE node.  The connectivity matrix describes the
   connectivity for the express paths between the different lines of the
   ROADM and the local link connectivity list describes the connectivity
   for the Add and Drop paths of the ROADM.  These matrices are
   augmented with a new roadm-path-impairment matrix element, an add-
   path-impairment, and drop-path-impairment matrix element,
   respectively, which are defined as a pointer to the corresponding
   entry in the roadm-path-impairments list (leaf-ref).

2.11.  Optical Protection Architectures

   The YANG model defined in this document supports the following
   optical protection architectures:

   *  Individual OTSi protection

   *  OMS MCG protection = TE-link protection between adjacent WDM-TE-
      nodes

2.11.1.  Individual OTSi Protection

   Individual OTSi protection is a protection architecture where an
   individual OTSi signal is protected as described in Appendix III of
   ITU-T Recommendation G.873.1 [G.873.1].  This protection architecture
   requires specific photonic protection functions in the optical domain
   that are typically provided by specific protection hardware.  These
   photonic protection functions are a photonic splitter function
   splitting the OTSi signal in the transmit direction and a photonic
   selector function selecting the OTSi signal in the receive direction
   from one of the two protection legs between the two protection
   functions terminating the individual OTSi protection.  This
   individual OTSi protection scheme can be considered as a photonic 1+1
   protection scheme (1+1 sub-network connection protection (SNCP) in
   ITU-T terminology).

Internet-Draft    Opt. Impairment-Aware Topo YANG Model    February 2026


   To achieve short protection switching times, it is necessary that the
   OTSi signals of the two legs are identical in terms of wavelength,
   modulation format, FEC, etc., which means no receiver configuration
   changes when a protection switch at the selector occurs selecting the
   other leg.  This is important when 3R regenerators are needed between
   the two end-points terminating the protected segment, which typically
   is end-to-end.

   In case of individual OTSi protection without 3R regenerators, two
   end-to-end MC paths are associated with the OTSi signal.  In the YANG
   model, this is modeled as leaf list of the OTSi providing the e2e-mc-
   path-id for the two end-to-end MC paths associated with the
   individually 1+1 protected OTSi.  This scenario is depicted in
   Figure 11 (forward direction) and Figure 12 (reverse direction)
   below.

   and WDM Node7 as well as WDM Node7 and WDM Node2.

   If a 3R regenerator is crossed on one of the two legs or even on both
   legs, the end-to-end MCs are terminated on both sides of the 3R
   regenerator.  The configured-termination-type attribute set to "3r-
   regeneration" SHALL be used to indicate that the transceivers are
   forming a 3R regenerator instead of terminating the layer 0 tunnel
   (layer 0 service).  At WDM-nodes containing a 3R regenerator, the
   end-2-end MCs are stitched together forming the end-to-end path for

   the layer 0 tunnel (layer 0 service).  This is reflected in the leaf
   list of the OTSi, which now lists all e2e-mc-path-ids of the end-to-
   end MC paths on the two legs of the individually 1+1 protected OTSi
   signal.

   In the scenario depicted in Figure 13 and Figure 14 below where a 3R
   regenerator is crossed in WDM Node6 on the lower leg, the e2e-mc-
   path-id leaf list has 3 entries (assumption: the same e2e-mc-path-id
   can be used for the path in the forward and reverse directions):

   1.  The e2e-mc-path-id identifying end-to-end MC path1 from WDM Node1
       via WDM Node3 and WDM Node4 to WDM Node2 as well as end-to-end MC
       path1' in the reverse direction (upper leg)

   2.  The e2e-mc-path-id identifying end-to-end MC path2 from WDM Node1
       via WDM Node5 to WDM Node6 containing the 3R regenerator as well
       as end-to-end MC path2' in the reverse direction (left hand
       segment of the lower leg)

   3.  The e2e-mc-path-id identifying end-to-end MC path3 from WDM Node6
       containing the 3R regenerator via WDM Node7 to WDM Node2 as well
       as end-to-end MC path3' in the reverse direction (right hand
       segment of the lower leg)

   Based on this modeling approach it is possible to identify the end-
   2-end MCs stitched together at 3R regenerators on each of the two
   legs of the individually protected 1+1 OTSi signal.  Similarly, for
   the case without 3R regenerators it is also possible to associate two
   end-to-end paths in the forward and reverse directions for the two
   legs between the optical transponders terminating the individually
   1+1 protected OTSi in WDM Node1 and WDM Node2, respectively:

   1.  end-to-end MC path1 and end-to-end MC path1' (upper leg)
   2.  end-to-end MC path2 and end-to-end MC path2' stitched together
       with end-to-end MC path3 and end-to-end MC path3' (lower leg)

                           (reverse direction)

   Individual OTSi protection use cases:

   (i)    OT and OTSi protection function are an integral part of the
          WDM-TE-node

   (ii)   OT and OTSi protection/ROADM functions are in two adjacent
          WDM-TE-nodes (remote OT)

   (iii)  OT and OTSi protection function are both in the adjacent WDM-
          TE-node (protected remote OT)

   The different use cases are described in the following sub-sections
   and examples are provided as to how these uses cases can be modeled
   properly using the impairment-aware TE-topology YANG data model for
   optical networks.

2.11.1.1.  OT and OTSi protection function are an integral part of the
           WDM-TE-node

   This use case is based on the architecture illustrated in Figure 8
   and the following entities are all integral parts of the WDM-TE-node:

   *  Local optical transponder
   *  Splitter/selector protection function
   *  ROADM function

   Figure 15 illustrates such a WDM-TE-node configuration in the
   transmit/forward direction where the protection function is an
   optical splitter and Figure 16 illustrates the same WDM-TE-node
   configuration in the receive/reverse direction where the protection
   function is an optical selector selecting one of the two incoming
   OTSi signals and switching to the other incoming OTSi signal when the
   optical power of the selected OTSi signal drops below a pre-defined
   threshold.

   The TE-topology YANG model has been augmented to describe this
   protection architecture.  The already existing optional protection-
   type leaf of the TTP associated with the optical transceiver is used
   to indicate whether the TTP is protected, i.e., whether it is
   connected to a protection function or whether it is unprotected,
   i.e., whether it is directly connected to an add-drop port of the
   ROADM function in the WDM-TE-node.

   For unprotected TTPs associated with an optical transceiver, the
   local-link-connectivity list (LLCL) as defined in [RFC8795] describes
   the potential connectivity between the TTP and the LTPs of the WDM-
   TE-node that are the local end-points of the TE-links (OMS MCGs)
   interconnecting the WDM-TE-node with its neighbors, also often called
   degrees of the WDM-TE-node as opposed to its add-drop ports.

   For protected TTPs, the local-link-connectivity list has been
   augmented such that the potential connectivity can now be described
   between the TTP and multiple LTPs including the related optical
   impairments.  Without this new capability, it was only possible to
   describe the potential connectivity between a TTP and a single LTP
   (unprotected case).  If the optical impairments are the same for all
   local-link-connectivity list entries for a particular TTP, which is
   usually the case, the optical impairments should be omitted for the
   additional LTPs leading to a more compact topology description.  If
   the optical impairments are different, however, they can be described
   for each additional LTP entry separately.

   A local-link-connectivity list example for a protected TTP in JSON
   format is provided in Appendix B.

      Figure 16: OT and OTSI protection function are an integral part
                  of the WDM-TE- node (receive direction)

2.11.1.2.  OT and OTSi protection/ROADM functions are in two adjacent
           WDM-TE-node (remote OT)

   This use case is based on the architecture illustrated in Figure 9
   where the optical transponder is not part of the WDM-TE-node
   containing the ROADM function (WDM-TE-node-2) but is part of a
   separate WDM-TE-node (WDM-TE-node-1) containing one or more optical
   transponders (remote OTs).  WDM-TE-node-2 contains:

   *  Splitter/selector protection function
   *  ROADM function

   Figure 17 illustrates such a network configuration in the transmit/
   forward direction showing the two WDM-TE-nodes where the protection
   function is the optical splitter in WDM-TE-node-2 and Figure 18
   illustrates the same network configuration in the receive/reverse
   direction where the protection function is the optical selector in
   WDM-TE-node-2 selecting one of the two incoming OTSi signals and
   switching to the other incoming OTSi signal when the optical power of
   the selected OTSi signal drops below a pre-defined threshold.

   In the network configuration shown in Figure 17 and Figure 18,
   respectively, the two WDM-TE-nodes are interconnected via a TE-link
   carrying a single OTSi signal.  This TE-link interconnects the remote
   OT with an add-drop port of WDM-TE-node-2 and in the following the
   qualifier "add-drop" is used to refer to that LTP as opposed to the
   line LTPs representing degrees of WDM-TE-node-2.  Like for the
   protected TTP in Section 2.11.1.1, the optional protection-type leaf
   is used to indicate whether the add-drop LTP is connected to a
   protection function and then to two line LTPs via the ROADM function
   inside WDM-TE-node-2 or whether it is connected to a single line LTP
   via the ROADM function inside WDM-TE-node-2 (unprotected add-drop
   LTP).  While the protection-type attribute was already defined for
   the TTP, the YANG model has been augmented to also support this
   optional attribute for the LTP.

   For protected LTPs, the connectivity-matrix has been augmented such
   that the potential connectivity can now be described between an add-
   drop LTP and multiple line LTPs including the related optical
   impairments.  Without this new capability, it was only possible to
   describe the potential connectivity between an add-drop LTP and a
   single line LTP (unprotected case).  If the optical impairments are
   the same from the protected add-drop LTP to all line LTPs, which is
   usually the case, the optical impairments should be omitted for the
   additional LTPs leading to a more compact connectivity matrix
   description.  If the optical impairments are different, however, they
   can be described for each additional LTP separately.

       Figure 18: OT and OTSi protection/ROADM functions are in two
           adjacent WDM-TE- node (remote OT, receive direction)

2.11.1.3.  OT and protection function are both in an adjacent WDM-TE-
           node (protected remote OT)

   The use case illustrated in Figure 19 is similar to the use case in
   Section 2.11.1.1.  The difference is that WDM-TE-node-1 does not
   contain the ROADM function but contains:

   *  Optical transponder function including the transceiver
   *  Splitter/selector protection function

   WDM-TE-node-1 can be a data center device or a router device that is
   supporting 1+1 OTSi protection for its OTs while WDM-TE-node-2 is a
   WDM-TE-node providing add-drop ports for remote OTs as depicted in
   Figure 9.  WDM-TE-node-1 and WDM-TE-node-2 are interconnected via two
   separate TE-links, each carrying a single OTSi signal.  The
   protection configuration for the protected TTP in WDM-TE-node-1 can
   be described in the same way as for the use in Section 2.11.1.1 using
   the local-link-connectivity list.

2.11.2.  OMS MCG protection

   OMS MCG protection is a 1+1 protection architecture where a TE-link
   representing an OMS MCG between two adjacent WDM-TE-nodes is 1+1
   protected.  This media layer protection type is also described in
   Appendix III of [G.873.1_Amd1].  Figure 20 illustrates this 1+1 OMS
   MCG protection type and shows a 1+1 protected TE-link together with
   an unprotected TE-link between the same two adjacent WDM-TE-nodes.
   The protected TE-link in Figure 20 is composed of an underlying
   primary and secondary TE-link.  This modeling approach is described
   below.

   1+1 OMS MCG protection is a local protection scheme, which can be
   modeled based on TE-link properties already defined in [RFC8795].
   The 1+1 protected TE-link is associated with the two underlying TE-
   links representing the physical links, which are forming the 1+1
   protection group together with the splitter and selector functions in
   the adjacent WDM-TE-nodes as depicted in Figure 20.  This modeling
   approach is described in more detail in Section 2.11.2.1.

   Alternatively, it is possible to model the 1+1 OMS MCG protection as
   single protected TE-link abstracting the two underlying physical
   links as well as the splitter and selector functions in the two
   adjacent WDM-TE-nodes.  This modeling approach is described in more
   detail in Section 2.11.2.2.

   For both modeling approaches, the splitter and selector functions are
   not represented as separate entities in the model.  Their optical
   impairments can be included in the optical impairments of the ROADM
   paths in the two adjacent WDM-TE-nodes (connectivity matrix and LLCL,
   respectively) or in the optical impairments of the 1+1 protected TE-
   link abstracting the two underlying physical OMS links.

2.11.2.1.  OMS MCG Protection Modeled as Protected TE-link with
           underlying TE-links

   This modeling approach models the 1+1 protected TE-link as an
   additional TE-link entity on top of the primary and secondary TE-link
   between the two adjacent WDM-TE-nodes terminating the 1+1 OMS MCG
   protection group formed by these two TE-links and the splitter and
   selector functions in the two nodes.  This 1+1 protected TE-link is
   associated with underlying primary and secondary TE-links forming the
   1+1 protection group.  The following "te-link-attributes" already
   defined in [RFC8795] and [I-D.ietf-teas-rfc8776-update] can be used
   for modeling the 1+1 protected TE-link ("te-link-attributes")
   augmentation copied from [RFC8795]:

     augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nt:link:
     +--rw te!
        +--rw te-link-attributes
        |  ....................
        |  +--rw underlay {te-topology-hierarchy}?
        |  |  +--rw enabled?                     boolean
        |  |  +--rw primary-path
        |  |  |  +--rw network-ref?    leafref
        |  |  |     ....................
        |  |  +--rw backup-path* [index]
        |  |  |  +--rw index           uint32
        |  |  |  +--rw network-ref?    leafref
        |  |  |     ....................
        |  ....................
        |  +--rw link-protection-type?           identityref
        |  ....................

   These attributes are used as follows:

   *  "underlay": the presence of this container indicates that an
      underlying protection scheme exists
   *  "enabled": (boolean) is set to 'true'
   *  "primary-path": is referencing the primary OMS MCG (TE-link)
   *  "backup-path": is referencing the secondary OMS MCG (TE-link)
   *  "link-protection-type" (identityref) set to 'link-protection-1-
      plus-1' as defined in [I-D.ietf-teas-rfc8776-update]

   The optical impairments for the underlying primary and secondary TE-
   link can be described as for unprotected TE-links.  It MAY also be
   possible to only describe the optical impairments for the 1+1
   protected TE-link.  In this case the optical impairments of the worst
   of the two underlying TE-links shall be used.  This should be
   sufficient as input for path computation (worst case optical
   feasibility consideration).

   The optical impairments of the splitter (outgoing direction) and the
   selector (incoming direction) are included in the optical impairments
   described by the connectivity matrix and the local link connectivity
   list for the TE node.  For the example shown in Figure 21 in the
   forward direction, the connectivity matrix describes the optical
   impairments between LPT1 and LTP2 as well as LTP1 and LTP3 for WDM-
   TE-node-1.  Likewise, the connectivity matrix describes the optical
   impairments between LPT4 and LTP6 as well as LTP5 and LTP6 in WDM-TE-
   node-2.  The same applies to the corresponding LTPs in the reverse
   direction.

2.11.2.2.  OMS MCG Protection Modeled as Single Protected TE-link

   This modeling approach abstracts the two physical OMS links carrying
   the same OMS MCG together with the splitter and selector functions in
   the two WDM-TE-nodes forming the OMS protection group into a single
   TE-link.  When this modeling approach is used the "te-link-
   attributes" already defined in [RFC8795] and
   [I-D.ietf-teas-rfc8776-update] are used as follows:

    augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nt:link:
     +--rw te!
        +--rw te-link-attributes
        |  ....................
        |  +--rw link-protection-type?           identityref
        |  ....................

   *  "underlay": this container MUST NOT be present
   *  "link-protection-type" (identityref) set to 'link-protection-1-
      plus-1' as defined in [I-D.ietf-teas-rfc8776-update]

   The optical impairments exposed for this 1+1 protected TE-link are
   typically based on the optical impairments of the worse of the two
   underlying physical OMS links including the optical impairments
   imposed by the splitter (outgoing direction) and selector (incoming
   direction).

Internet-Draft    Opt. Impairment-Aware Topo YANG Model    February 2026


   Figure 23 and Figure 24 illustrate this modeling approach where the
   splitter/selector in the adjacent WDM-TE-nodes, WDM-TE-node-1 and
   WDM-TE-node-2, as well as the two physical OMS MCG links are
   abstracted into a single 1+1 protected TE-link.  This is illustrated
   by the dotted line surrounding these four physical entities in
   Figure 23 and Figure 24, respectively.  Based on this modeling
   approach, the ROADM port connected to the splitter/selector function
   is modeled as LTP for the 1+1 protected TE-link (LTP2 in WDM-TE-
   node-1 and LTP3 in WDM-TE-node-2).  In this example, the connectivity
   matrix describes the optical impairments between LPT1 and LTP2 in
   WDM-TE-node-1.  Likewise, the connectivity matrix describes the
   optical impairments between LPT3 and LTP4 in WDM-TE-node-2.

           connectivity matrix provides optical impairments in

        Figure 24: Modeling view of abstracted 1+1 protected TE-link
             (reverse direction) - ROADM ports modeled as LTPs

   Alternatively, the optical impairments imposed by the splitter and
   selector in each of the two adjacent WDM-TE-nodes can also be
   included in the optical impairments described by the connectivity
   matrix of the two nodes instead of taking them into account as
   optical impairments of the 1+1 protected TE-link.  This is
   illustrated in Figure 25 in forward direction and Figure 26 in
   reverse direction below.  In this case, the two physical ports on
   both ends of the 1+1 protected TE-link are abstracted into a single
   LTP, LTP2 and LTP3, in forward direction and LTP3' and LTP2' in
   reverse direction.

3.1.  YANG Model Explanations

   As indicated in [RFC8345], section 4.1, "When a network is of a
   certain type, it will contain a corresponding data node.  Network
   types SHOULD always be represented using presence containers".  The
   YANG model is in fact augmenting "nw:network-types/tet:te-topology"
   with the new presence container "optical-impairment-topology"
   representing an impairment-aware topology type.

   As described in Section 2.3.1,the OTSi signals in the YANG model are
   described by augmenting the "nw:network" data node and each OTSi
   signal is uniquely identified by its otsi-carrier-id, which is unique
   within the scope the OTSiG the OTSi belongs to.





Beller, et al.           Expires 17 August 2026                [Page 92]

Internet-Draft    Opt. Impairment-Aware Topo YANG Model    February 2026


   As described in Section 2.3.2, all OTSiGs are described in the YANG
   model by augmenting the "nw:network" data node and each OTSiG is
   uniquely identified by its otsi-group-id, which is unique within the
   network.  Each OTSiG also contains a list of the OTSi signals
   belonging to the OTSiG.

   Any OTSi signal is terminated by a transceiver and that is modeled as
   a function of the tunnel termination point (TTP) and a "ttp-
   transceiver" list of transceivers augmenting the "tunnel-termination-
   point".

   The relationship between OTSi and the related transceiver is provided
   in the YANG model by the containers "incoming-otsi" for the OTSi
   received by the transceiver's receiver and "outgoing-otsi" for the
   OTSi generated by the transceiver's transmitter.

   As described in Section 2.7, transponders are usually used to
   terminate a layer 0 tunnel.  But, they also can be used to regenerate
   the signal and form a 3R regenarator.  No new entity is needed in the
   model since 3R functionality is provided by an optical transponder
   pair.  The YANG model provides two attributes related to 3R
   regenerators: "supported-termination-type" and "supported-3r-mode".

   supported-termination-type is describing if an optical transponder is
   supporting tunnel termination only, or 3R regenerator only, or both.

   supported-3r-mode gives the configuration of transponder pair
   providing the 3R functionality, if back-to-back (see Figure 6) or
   Cross-3R (see Figure 7).

   The model also provides a "regen-group" list and each list entry
   represents a group of transponders that support the 3R functionality.
   "transponder-ref" is pointing to the transponders belonging to any
   specific group.

   The data node "inter-layer-sequence-number" augments the termination
   point attribute to describe additional constraints between a client
   layer Link Termination Point (LTP), e.g., a muxponder port and a
   server layer LTP.

   To improve scalability, the model is defining templates for both,
   "roadm-path-impairments-set", the list of the set of optical
   impairments related to ROADM paths (express, add and drop paths) and
   "explicit-transceiver-mode",the list of optical parameters related to
   a transceiver’s explicit mode providing the cpability attributes and
   optical impairment limits of an explicit transceiver mode.  These
   templates are also defined as "network" augmentation.

Internet-Draft    Opt. Impairment-Aware Topo YANG Model    February 2026


   As stated in Section 2.6, the model defines three types of approaches
   to describes the transceiver capabilities (called "modes"):

   *  Standard Modes

   *  Organizational Modes

   *  Explicit Modes

   These different modes (described in Section 2.6.1, Section 2.6.2, and
   Section 2.6.3 are defined under the "transponders" presence container
   augmenting the data node "node" as defined in [RFC8345].  If present,
   this container will indicate that the set of transponders/
   transceivers in a node are described with all the impairments
   attribute depending on the supported mode type of any specific
   transponder.  The YANG model permits to describe the transponder
   capabilities in a mixed way (a transceiver can support more than one
   mode out of the three mode types).

   Section 2.3 followed by Section 2.3.3, and Section 2.3.4d describe
   the OMS MCG and the OTS MCG and the model represents this entity as a
   WDM TE-link interconnecting two WDM-TE-nodes.  The model augments the
   te-link-attributes defined in [RFC8795] with the optical impairments
   for the WDM TE-link of the layer-0 topology related to a specific
   network controller domain.

   As described in detail in Section 2.10, the optical impairments
   imposed by passive or active optical ROADM components for the three
   different ROADM path types have to be taken into account when an OTSi
   signal crosses a ROADM node.  The following two entities defined in
   [RFC8795] are used to describe the optical impairments for the 3 MC
   path types: "connectivity-matrix" for express paths and "local-link-
   connectivity-list" for Add/Drop paths crossing the ROADM.

   A list of optical impairment sets "roadm-path-impairments-set" is
   defined under "templates", and this parameter set list entries will
   contain the optical impairments for express, add, and drop paths.

   The connectivity-matrix is augmented with the optical impairment sets
   for the ROADM's express-path contained in the "roadm-path-
   impairments-set", while the LLCL is augmented with the optical
   impairment sets contained in the "roadm-path-impairments-set" for the
   ROADM's add-path and drop-path by using leafref "add-
   path.impairments-set" and leafref "drop-path-impairments-set".

   In case OTSi protection is supported, a list of additional line LTPs
   is defined in the model to represent potential connectivity between
   an add-drop LTP/TTP and multiple line LTPs including the related

   optical impairments.  See Section 2.11.1.2 for more details).
   Additional OTSi protection architectures are described in detail in
   Section 2.11.1.1 and Section 2.11.1.3.

4.  Security Considerations

   This section is based on the template in Section 3.7 of
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis].

   The "ietf-optical-impairment-topology" YANG module defines a data
   model that is designed to be accessed via YANG-based management
   protocols, such as NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040].  These
   YANG-based management protocols

   (1)  have to use a secure transport layer (e.g., SSH [RFC4252], TLS
        [RFC8446], and QUIC [RFC9000] and

   (2)  have to use mutual authentication.

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are no particularly sensitive readable data nodes.

   This YANG module uses groupings from other YANG modules that define
   nodes that may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in network
   environments.  Refer to the Security Considerations of
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-rfc9093-bis] for information as to which nodes may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in network environments.

   Finally, the YANG module described in this document augments the
   "ietf-network" YANG module [RFC8345] and the "ietf-te-topology" YANG
   module [RFC8795] by adding data nodes.  The security considerations
   for the subtrees described in those RFCs apply equally to the new
   data nodes that this module adds.

Appendix B.  JSON Code Examples for Optical Protection Uses Cases

   (1)  JSON example for use case in Section 2.11.1.1 with full and with
        restricted connectivity:

   The JSON example below addresses the optical protection use case for
   TTPs associated with local optical transponders (integrated WDM-TE-
   node):

   *  where full connectivity exists between the ROADM add-drop ports
      and the ROADM ports for the different ROADM degrees illustrated in
      Figure 27 below.
   *  where restricted connectivity exists between the ROADM add-drop
      ports and the ROADM ports for the different ROADM degrees
      illustrated in Figure 28 below.

   Note that Figure 27 and Figure 28 illustrate the connectivity for a
   single TTP only, i.e., the figures are not showing TTP-1, TTP-2, TTP-
   3, and TTP-4, which are used in the JSON code example below.

   The connectivity is reflected in the local-link-connectivities
   between the TTP associated with the transceiver of the local OT and
   the LTPs that can be reached including the optical impairments for
   the different paths.

   (2)  JSON example for use case in Section 2.11.1.2 with restricted
        connectivity:

   The JSON example below addresses the optical protection use case
   where the optical transponder is not part of the WDM-TE-node
   containing the ROADM function (WDM-TE-node-2) but is part of a
   separate WDM-TE-node (WDM-TE-node-1) containing one or more optical
   transponders (remote OTs).  As described in Section 2.11.1.2, a TE-
   link interconnects the remote OT with an add-drop port of WDM-TE-
   node-2.  This is illustrated in Figure 29.

   In this use case, the connectivity is reflected in the connectivity-
   matrix describing the connectivity between the LTPs representing an
   add-drop port in WDM-TE-node-2 connected to the transceiver of a
   remote OT and the LTPs associated with the different ROADM degrees
   including the optical impairments for the different paths.

       Figure 30: Optical Transponders in a Remote Shelf (Remote OTs)

   As described in Section 2.3, the external shelf can be modeled as
   WDM-TE-node with termination capability only (not switching) and the
   add/drop link between a remote optical transceiver and a ROADM add/
   drop port can be modeled as a WDM TE-link with the same optical
   impairments as those defined for a WDM TE-link between WDM-TE-nodes
   (OMS MCG).

   If the two WDM-TE-nodes are reported in different network topology
   instances, the plug-id attribute, defined in [RFC8795], can be used
   to discover the adjacency for add/drop TE-links.

   It is worth noting that there are no standard protocols for automatic
   discovery of the adjacency between an external transceiver and a
   ROADM add/drop port and therefore the information reported in the
   plug-id can be either statically configured or provided through
   vendor-specific discovery mechanisms.

   Each add/drop TE-link carries a single OTSi between the transceiver
   and ROADM add/drop port and one or more OTSis in the reverse
   direction (between the ROADM add/drop and the transceiver).

   Depending on control architecture (e.g., when the two WDM-TE-nodes
   are reported in different network topology instances by different
   controllers), the controller reporting the WDM-TE-node, abstracting
   the external OT shelf, may be not able to provide the information
   about the end-to-end MC configuration (i.e.,flexi-n and flexi-m) nor
   of all the received OTSis, within the end-to-end MC, besides the
   configured incoming OTSi, since the end-to-end MC configuration
   depends on how the ROADM network is configured and the remote OT
   shelf is not aware of that.

   In this case only the incoming-otsi and outgoing-otsi can be reported
   within an end-to-end MC with an unspecified frequency-slot (i.e.,
   without reporting flexi-n and flexi-m configuration of the end-to-end
   MC).

   When an OTSiG has more than one OTSi, its OTSis are carried by
   different parallel add/drop TE-links.  In order to represent the fact
   that these OTSis are co-routed, the add/drop TE-links are bundled
   together in a bundled add/drop TE-link.  The finest granularity for
   the bundled add/drop TE-link is the set of all the add/drop TE-links
   terminating on the same OT.

   For example, in Figure 30, it is possible to define two bundled add/
   drop TE-links, one for OT1 and one for OT2 or just one add/drop TE-
   link both OTs.

   The model for a bundled add/drop TE-link and the relationship with
   its component TE-links is already defined in the bundled-links
   container of [RFC8795].

   In the general case, the optical impairments and connectivity
   constraints are reported for each add/drop TE-link and therefore no
   optical impairments are reported in the bundled add/drop TE-link that
   is used just to model the co-routing aspects of the OTSis belonging
   to the same OTSiG.

   The per-transceiver Local Link Connectivity (LLC) is used in the WDM-
   TE-node which abstracts the remote OT shelf (e.g., WDM-TE-node-1 in
   Figure 30), to represent the association between each transceiver and
   each LTP terminating the add/drop TE-link which models the
   transceiver port.

   The connectivity matrix in the WDM-TE-node which abstract the edge
   ROADM (e.g., WDM-TE-node-2 in Figure 30) references the LTPs
   terminating the add/drop TE-links which models the ROADM add/drop
   ports.
