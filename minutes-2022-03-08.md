## Discussion


### Review APs (action point) 

#### AP OTSi global unique identification: Dieter to propose text
##### status: ON GOING
##### issue #88 https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/88
 

#### AP on discovery: AP @Italo  to add specific issue to clarify how the link between external shelf and ROADM is discovered
##### status: ON GOING

### issues on agenda


#### issue#102 : copropagating raman
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/102

The agreement was to add "pump-power", "frequency" and "direction" attributes as described in Gert's comment
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/102#issue-1126058417

#### AP @Esther: to check with PoliTO at TIP-OOPT-PSE WG possible description of pump-power and frequency.
##### status : done 

We got positive answer and approval of our solution by PoliTO experts in TIP. 
The proposed YANG proposal has been added in the YANG update of PR#104 https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/pull/104

The issue #102 has been closed with the update for IETF-113

#### issue#24 : Model alignment with 400G-ZR
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/24

* There was a common agreement that the model is already suitable for any pluggable , no needs to have a specific model to cover 400G ZR+
* ZR+ is specified in OpenROADM , and as such it can be managed as an “MSA” fora organizational mode, see section 2.5.2 
that already mention for a as part of organizational mode case.
* We need to be sure that this MSA organizational mode can be a superset of the list of explicit attributes.
Need to be check the list of needed parameters for ZR+ (Gabriele)
* There could be an OTN compatibility issue for ZR+ that has to be verified. This could be an issue in case of 3R. 
Not only for ZR+ we could consider the opportunity to add an attribute to provide information regarding digital compatibility.

In general:
* The model with operational modes seems providing already way to manage compatibility issues
* We should probably digging more in scenario with 3R, but also in this case seems that operational mode could be enough.
* Client information are input of path computation, and are not part of the topology model. We can suppose that other model already provided this information.
* In case of zr+ we can add sentence to specify to be careful about operational modes e.g. you could have zr+-ethernet and zr+-otn
* The way happens ODUflex ODUCn mapping is an input to path computation. Maybe operational mode could be not sufficient. 
AP @Italo to check with ITU guys.

Gabriele was out of the meeting and we decided to wait for him to analyse more carefully his comment on
https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/issues/24#issuecomment-1054238457 before closing eventually the issue

### issue on layer0-types-ext PR for IETF-113

2 issues have been raised by Esther during the review of the YANG update done for IETF-113 PR#36 https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext/pull/36

#### issue#38 Shouldn't penalty be a decimal value: https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext/issues/38

The decision was that the penalty should be decimal and we can add a new typedef e.g. decimal-in-db with 2 digits similar to power-in-db:
typedef power-in-db {
    type decimal-2-digits;
    units dB;
    description
      "The power in dB.";
}

#### issue#39 Shouldn't max-diff-group-delay be a decimal value: https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-ccamp-layer0-types-ext/issues/39

The decision was that "picosecond" is a standard unit of measuring time and having integer is acceptable (uint32).

### Esther's feedback from TIP-MUST

About the amplifier model operators (not Orange) want to have a model able to have a more detailed description of amplifiers. 
In IETF we have abstracted some details since the type and characteristic of any amplifiers are described with type-variety pointing to an external library.
Instead operators want to have a choice on how to describe the amplifier.
They want to get information from device instead to exploit from external library.
Eshter observed that also n case of type-variety you could built automatically the library out of device, 
in this case it would be more accurate than if the library would be obtained by external means.
What operator saying is that they want a model that if vendors are providing more parameters they need a model permitting to manage directly
all these parameters e.g. for gain we provide actual-gain , no 4 coefficient for polinomial computation.

In conclusion, there is no a direct impact on our model but we need to monitor the situation and maybe in future to be open to change
the model in line with what done for transponder with a "choice" among organizational, G.698.2 or explicit modes.
